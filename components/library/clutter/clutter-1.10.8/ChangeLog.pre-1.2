    clutter-actor: Initialize with the identity matrix in get_transform
    
    The documentation and name of the get_transformation_matrix function
    implies that 'matrix' is purely an out parameter. However it wasn't
    initializing the matrix before calling the 'apply_transform' virtual
    so it was basically just a wrapper for the virtual. The virtual
    assumes the matrix parameter is in/out and applies the actor's
    transformation on top of any existing transformations. This causes
    unexpected semantics that are inconsistent with the documentation.

    glx tfp: make clutter_glx_texture_pixmap_update_area cheap
    
    This changes clutter_glx_texture_pixmap_update_area so it defers the
    call to glXBindTexImageEXT until our pre "paint" signal handler which
    makes clutter_glx_texture_pixmap_update_area cheap to call.
    
    The hope is that mutter can switch to reporting raw damage updates to
    ClutterGLXTexturePixmap and we can use these to queue clipped redraws.

commit c0d5af5de5bcc504abeb81a7f7a1ec0f696b574d
Author: Robert Bragg <robert@linux.intel.com>

    Adds initial clipped redraw support to Clutter
    
    A new (internal only currently) API, _clutter_actor_queue_clipped_redraw
    can be used to queue a redraw along with a clip rectangle in actor
    coordinates. This clip rectangle propagates up to the stage and clutter
    backend which may optionally use the information to optimize stage
    redraws. The GLX backend in particular may scissor the next redraw to
    the clip rectangle and use GLX_MESA_copy_sub_buffer to present the stage
    subregion.
    
    The intention is that any actors that can naturally determine the bounds
    of updates should queue clipped redraws to reduce the cost of updating
    small regions of the screen.
    
    Notes:
    » If GLX_MESA_copy_sub_buffer isn't available then the GLX backend
      ignores any clip rectangles.
    
    » queuing multiple clipped redraws will result in the bounding box of
      each clip rectangle being used.
    
    » If a clipped redraw has a height > 300 pixels then it's promoted into
      a full stage redraw, so that the GPU doesn't end up blocking too long
      waiting for the vsync to reach the optimal position to avoid tearing.
    
      » Note: no empirical data was used to come up with this threshold so
        we may need to tune this.
    
    » Currently only ClutterX11TexturePixmap makes use of this new API. This
      is done via a new "queue-damage-redraw" signal that is emitted when
      the pixmap is updated. The default handler queues a clipped redraw
      with the assumption that the pixmap is being painted as a rectangle
      covering the actors transformed allocation. If you subclass
      ClutterX11TexturePixmap and change how it's painted you now also
      need to override the signal handler and queue your own redraw.
    
      Technically this is a semantic break, but it's assumed that no one
      is currently doing this.
    
    This still leaves a few unsolved issues with regards to optimizing sub
    stage redraws that need to be addressed in further work so this can only
    be considered a stepping stone a this point:
    
    » Because we have no reliable way to determine if the painting of any
      given actor is being modified any optimizations implemented using
      _clutter_actor_queue_redraw_with_clip must be overridable by a
      subclass, and technically must be opt-in for existing classes to avoid
      a change in semantics. E.g. consider that a user connects to the paint
      signal for ClutterTexture and paints a circle instead of a rectangle.
      In this case any original logic to queue clipped redraws would be
      incorrect.
    
    » Currently only the implementation of an actor has enough information
      with which to queue clipped redraws. E.g. It is not possible for
      generic code in clutter-actor.c to queue a clipped redraw when hiding
      an actor because actors have no way to report a "paint box". (remember
      actors can draw outside their allocation and actors with depth may
      also be projected outside of their allocation)
    
      » The current plan is to add a actor_class->get_paint_cuboid()
        virtual so actors can report a bounding cube for everything they
        would draw in their current state and use that to queue clipped
        redraws against the stage by projecting the paint cube into stage
        coordinates.
    
    » Our heuristics for promoting clipped redraws into full redraws to
      avoid blocking the GPU while we wait for the vsync need improving:
    
      » vsync issues aren't relevant for redirected/composited applications
        so they should use different heuristics. In this case we instead
        need to trade off the cost of blitting when using glXCopySubBuffer
        vs promoting to a full redraw and flipping instead.

    cogl: Support any format in cogl_read_pixels
    
    cogl_read_pixels() no longer asserts that the format passed in is
    RGBA_8888 but instead accepts any format. The appropriate GL enums for
    the format are passed to glReadPixels so OpenGL should be perform a
    conversion if neccessary.
    
    It currently assumes glReadPixels will always give us premultiplied
    data. This will usually be correct because the result of the default
    blending operations for Cogl ends up with premultiplied data in the
    framebuffer. However it is possible for the framebuffer to be in
    whatever format depending on what CoglMaterial is used to render to
    it. Eventually we may want to add a way for an application to inform
    Cogl that the framebuffer is not premultiplied in case it is being
    used for some special purpose.
    
    If the requested format is not premultiplied then Cogl will convert
    it. The tests have been changed to read the data as premultiplied so
    that they won't be affected by the conversion. Picking in Clutter has
    been changed to use COGL_PIXEL_FORMAT_RGB_888 because it doesn't need
    the alpha component. clutter_stage_read_pixels is left unchanged
    because the application can't specify a format for that so it seems to
    make most sense to store unpremultiplied values.

    profile: avoid segfault generating reports with no stats
    
    The clutter-profile.c print_report() code would crash if no stats had
    been gathered because uprof would return NULL for the "Redrawing" timer
    which we then dereferenced.
    
    This changes the code to start by checking for the "Mainloop",
    "Redrawing" and "Do Pick" timers and if none are present it returns
    immediately without generating any report.

    build: Fixes out of tree builds
    
    When building the gobject introspection data the build wasn't able to
    find clutter/clutter-json.h so this adds $(top_builddir) to INCLUDES.

    Remove mentions of the FSF address
    
    Since using addresses that might change is something that finally
    the FSF acknowledge as a plausible scenario (after changing address
    twice), the license blurb in the source files should use the URI
    for getting the license in case the library did not come with it.
    
    Not that URIs cannot possibly change, but at least it's easier to
    set up a redirection at the same place.
    
    As a side note: this commit closes the oldes bug in Clutter's bug
    report tool.

    build: Remove unused checks on platform functions
    
    There is no need for us to check for low-level functions and header
    files, especially since we haven't been checking the results until
    now. This makes cross-compiling slightly more bearable.

    actor: Call unparent() in destroy
    
    If the actor is an internal child of another actor then we should call
    unparent() when destroying it, like clutter_actor_reparent() does;
    otherwise we'll leak the actor, since the parent holds a reference to
    it.

    Instead of shadowing these properties with different properties with the

    cogl-vertex-buffer: Add support for unsigned int indices
    
    This adds a COGL_INDICES_TYPE_UNSIGNED_INT enum value so that unsigned
    ints can be used with cogl_vertex_buffer_indices_new.  Unsigned ints
    are not supported in core on GLES so a feature flag has also been
    added to advertise this. GLES only sets the feature if the
    GL_OES_element_index_uint extension is available. It is an error to
    call indices_new() with unsigned ints unless the feature is
    advertised.

      "columns" : [

        [ "int-column", "gint" ],
        [ "actor-column", "ClutterRectangle" ]
      ]
    }
    
    where 'columns' is an array containing arrays of column-name,
    column-type pairs.

    container: Expose create and destroy ChildMeta methods
    
    It is conceivable that Container implementations might add children
    outside of the Container::add() implementation - e.g. for packing at
    a specific index. Since the addition (and removal) might happen outside
    the common path we need to expose all the API that is implicitly called
    by ClutterContainer when adding and removing a child - namely the
    ChildMeta creation and destruction.

    gles2: Remove the special wrapper for glBindTexture
    
    Previously the GLES2 backend needed a special wrapper for
    glBindTexture because it needed to know the internal GL format of the
    texture in order to correctly implement the GL_MODULATE texture env
    mode. When GL_MODULATE is used then the RGB values are taken from the
    previous texture layer rather than being fetched from the
    texture. However since the material API was added Cogl no longer uses
    the GL_MODULATE texture env mode but instead always uses GL_COMBINE.
    
    Compiling the GLES2 backend broke since the more-texture-backends
    branch merge because the cogl_get_internal_gl_format function was
    removed and there was one place in GLES2 specific code that was using
    this to bind the texture.

    The texture layer combine functions are now hard coded to GL_COMBINE
    instead of GL_MODULATE. The combine function can be customized with

    Currently it will try to generate code for the constant color but it
    will use a uniform which does not exist.

    animation: Fix a typo
    
    This will teach me to check before compiling a version-dependent branch
    that I'm actually using my jhbuild environment and not the system

    Conditionally use G_VALUE_COLLECT_INIT() macro
    
    GLib 2.24 (but starting from the 2.23.2 unstable release) added a new
    macro for collecting GValues from a va_list.
    
    The newly added G_VALUE_COLLECT_INIT() macro should be used in place
    of initializing the GValue and calling G_VALUE_COLLECT(), and improves
    the collection performances by avoiding multiple checks, free and
    initialization calls.

    fixed layout: Store a back pointer to the Container
    
    When set_container() is called with a NULL container we cannot use the
    passed pointer to unset the CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT flag. We should
    store a back pointer to the container as object data (there's no need
    to add a Private data structure in this case) and unset the flag on the
    back pointer instead.

    layout: allow wider use of the CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT flag
    
    Previously only ClutterGroup was able to set the CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT
    flag which allows clutter-actor.c to avoid a relayout when showing or
    hiding fixed layout containers. Instead of it being the responsibility
    of the container to set this flag this patch makes the layout manager
    itself decide in the ::set_container method. This way both ClutterBox
    and ClutterGroup can take advantage of the optimization.

    clutter-box: Layer new actors on top of all others at the same depth
    
    g_list_insert_sorted inserts the new actor before all others that
    compare equal so for the normal case when all actors have depth==0
    this has the surprising behaviour of layering the actors in reverse
    order. To fix this it now manually inserts the actor in the right
    place by searching until it finds an actor at a higher depth and
    inserting before that.

    Changing the depth sort function to have inconsistent behaviour for
    nodes that compare equal breaks the stability of g_list_sort. It ends
    up so that every time clutter_container_sort_depth_order is called the
    order of all actors with the same depth is reversed.

    cogl debug: hint that all debugging paths are G_UNLIKELY
    
    Most Cogl debugging code conditions are marked as G_UNLIKELY with the
    intention of having the CPU branch prediction always assume the
    path is disabled so having debugging support in release binaries has
    negligible overhead.
    
    This patch simply fixes a few cases where we weren't using G_UNLIKELY.

    cogl debug: Makes COGL_DEBUG=all|verbose|help more useful
    
    COGL_DEBUG=all wasn't previously useful as there are several options
    that change the behaviour of Cogl and all together wouldn't help anyone
    debug anything.
    
    This patch makes it so COGL_DEBUG=all|verbose now only enables options
    that don't change the behaviour of Cogl, i.e. they only affect the
    amount of noise we'll print to a terminal.
    
    In addition to that this patch also improves the output from
    COGL_DEBUG=help so we now print a table of options including one liner
    descriptions of what each option enables.

    debug: Split debugging notes from behavioural modifiers
    
    Some of the ClutterDebugFlags are not meant as a logging facility: they
    actually change Clutter's behaviour at run-time.
    
    It would be useful to have this distinction ratified, and thus split
    ClutterDebugFlags into two: one DebugFlags for logging facilities and
    another set of flags for behavioural changes.
    
    This split is warranted because:
    
      • it should be possible to do "CLUTTER_DEBUG=all" and only have
        log messages on the output
    
      • it should be possible to use behavioural modifiers even on a
        Clutter that has been compiled without debugging messages
        support
    
    The commit adds two new debugging flags:
    
      ClutterPickDebugFlags - controlled by the CLUTTER_PICK environment
                              variable
    
      ClutterPaintDebugFlags - controlled by the CLUTTER_PAINT environment
                               variable
    
    The PickDebugFlags are:
    
      nop-picking
      dump-pick-buffers
    
    While the PaintDebugFlags is:
    
      disable-swap-events
    
    The mechanism is equivalent to the CLUTTER_DEBUG environment variable,
    but it does not depend on the debug level selected when configuring and
    compiling Clutter. The picking and painting debugging flags are
    initialized at clutter_init() time.

    device: Force ENTER on Stage with overlapping Actors
    
    If an actor is on the boundary of a Stage and the pointer for a device
    enters the Stage over that actor, the sequence of events currently is:
    
      ➔ ENTER (source: actor, related: NULL)
      ➔ MOTION
    
    Thus the Stage never gets an ENTER event. This is a regression from
    Clutter 1.0.
    
    The correct sequence is:
    
      ➔ ENTER (source: stage, related: NULL)
      ➔ ENTER (source: actor, related: stage)
      ➔ MOTION
    
    This also maps to the sequence of events sythesized by Clutter when
    leaving the Stage through an actor overlapping the Stage boundary.

    stage: Only clutter_stage_get_default() creates the default stage
    
    The introduction of the StageManager in 0.8 implied that the first Stage
    instance to be created was automatically assigned the status of "default
    stage". This was all well and good, since the default stage was created
    behind the curtains by the initialization sequence.
    
    Now that the initialization sequence does not create a default stage any
    longer, it means that the first stage created using clutter_stage_new()
    gets to be the default, and all special and warm and fuzzy - which also
    means that the first stage created by clutter_stage_new() cannot be
    destroyed or handled as any other stage. Whoopsie.
    
    Let's go back to the old semantics: the stage created by the first
    invocation of clutter_stage_get_default() is the default stage, and
    nothing else can be set as default. One day we'll be able to break the
    API and the whole default stage business will be a thing of the past.

    We now never query the width and height of the given texture object
    from OpenGL. The problem is that the user may be creating a Cogl
    texture from a texture_from_pixmap object where glTexImage2D was
    never called and the texture_from_pixmap spec doesn't clarify that
    it's reliable to query the width from OpenGL.
    
    This should address:

    device: Allow updating devices from embedding toolkits
    
    Embedding toolkits most likely will disable the event handling, so all
    the input device code will not be executed. Unfortunately, the newly
    added synthetic event generation of ENTER and LEAVE event pairs depends
    on having input devices.
    
    In order to unbreak things without reintroducing the madness of the
    previous code we should allow embedding toolkits to just update the
    state of an InputDevice by using the data contained inside the
    ClutterEvent. This strategy has two obvious reasons:
    
      • the embedding toolkit is creating a ClutterEvent by translating
        a toolkit-native event anyway
    
      • this is exactly what ClutterStage does when processing events
    
    We are, essentially, deferring input device handling to the embedding
    toolkits, just like we're deferring event handling to them.

    device: Impose per-backend DeviceManager
    
    The DeviceManager class should be abstract in Clutter, and implemented
    by each backend, as different backends will have different ways to
    detect, initialize and list devices; the X11 backend alone has *two*
    ways of dealing with devices.
    
    This commit makes DeviceManager an abstract class and delegates the
    device initialization and enumeration to per-backend sub-classes.
    
    The responsible for creating the device manager is, obviously, the
    backend singleton.
    
    The X11 and Win32 backends have been updated to the new layout; the
    Win32 backend has been updated blindly, so it might require additional
    testing.

    [event-x11] Don't relayout on window move
    
    ConfigureNotify is delivered on window movements too, but there is no
    need to queue a relayout on these as the viewport hasn't changed size.
    Check for the window actually changing size on ConfigureNotify before
    queueing a relayout.
    
    This fixes laggy window movement when moving a window in response to
    Clutter mouse motion events.

    cogl-clip-stack: Round the coords when clipping to a window rect
    
    The size and position of the window rectangle for clipping in
    try_pushing_rect_as_window_rect is calculated by projecting the
    rectangle coordinates. Due to rounding errors, this can end up with
    slightly off numbers like 34.999999. These were then being cast
    directly to an integer so it could end up off by one.
    
    This uses a new macro called COGL_UTIL_NEARBYINT which is a
    replacement for the C99 nearbyint function.

    Improve LEAVE events for border actors
    
    If an actor is lying on the border of the Stage it might miss the LEAVE
    event when the pointer of a device leaves the Stage window. Since the
    backend is unsetting the Stage back pointer on the InputDevice we can
    queue the emission of a LEAVE event on the pointer actor as well.

    As well as manually setting the geometry size, we needed to queue a

    but we don't get this event when using a foreign window (obviously).

    [stage-x11] Fix switching fullscreen mode
    
    Setting/unsetting fullscreen on a mapped or unmapped window now works
    correctly.
    
    If you unfullscreen a window that was initially full-screened, it will
    unset the fullscreen hint and the WM will likely push the size down to
    the largest valid size.
    
    If the window was previously un-fullscreened, Clutter will restore the
    previous size.
    
    Fullscreening also now works if the WM switches the hint without the
    application's knowledge (as happens when you resize a window to the size
    of the screen, for example, with stock metacity).

    conform: Do not resize the stage
    
    Since all conformance tests share the same state we should not touch
    stuff like the stage size; sharing is already fairly complex and adds a
    lot of caveats on the implementation of a conformance test unit, and if
    we make tests influence later ones then we might slip in bugs or false
    negatives - thus defeating the whole point of a conformance test suite.

    [stage] Fix some races to do with window resizing
    
    When we resize, we relied on the stage's allocate to re-initialise the
    GL viewport. Unfortunately, if we resized within Clutter, the new size
    was cached before the window is actually resized, so glViewport wasn't
    being called after resizing (some of the time, it's a race condition).
    
    Change the way resizing works slightly so that we only resize when the
    geometry size doesn't match our preferred size, and queue a relayout on
    ConfigureNotify so the glViewport gets called.
    
    Also change window creation slightly so that setting the size of a
    window before it's realized works correctly.

    actor: Turn push/pop_internal into Actor methods
    
    Since the "internal" state is global, it will leak onto actors that you
    didn't intend for it to, because it applies not just to the actors you
    create, but also to any actors *they* create. Eg, if you have a dialog
    box class, you might push/pop_internal around creating its buttons, so
    that those buttons get marked as internal to the dialog box. But
    ctx->internal_child will still be set during the *button*'s constructor
    as well, and so, eg, the label and icon inside the button actor will
    *also* be marked as internal children, even if that isn't what the
    button class wanted.
    
    The least intrusive change at this point is to make push_internal() and
    pop_internal() two methods of the Actor class, and take a ClutterActor
    pointer as the argument - thus moving the locality of the internal_child
    counter to the Actor itself.

    cogl-atlas-texture: Flush the journal before adding a new texture
    
    When the atlas is reorganised we could potentially be moving around
    textures that are already referenced in the journal. We therefore need
    to flush the journal otherwise they will be rendered with incorrect
    texture coordinates. We also need to flush the journal even if we are
    not reorganizing so that we can rely on the old texture contents
    remaining in the atlas after migrating a texture out.

    cogl-sub-texture: Optimise taking a sub texture of a sub texture
    
    When creating a Cogl sub-texture, if the full texture is also a sub
    texture it will now just offset the x and y and reference the full
    texture instead. This avoids one level of indirection when rendering
    the texture which reduces the chances of getting rounding errors in
    the calculations.

    actor: Split get_paint_opacity() from the type check
    
    Since get_paint_opacity() recurses through the hierarchy it might lead
    to a lot of type checks while we walk the parent-child chain. We can
    split the recursive function from the public entry point and perform the
    type check just once.

    The function _cogl_get_max_texture_units is called quite often while

    cogl_rectangle: avoid redundant copy of geometry
    
    All the cogl_rectangle* APIs normalize their input into into an array of
    _CoglMutiTexturedRect rectangles and pass these on to our work horse;
    _cogl_rectangles_with_multitexture_coords. The definition of
    _CoglMutiTexturedRect had 4 separate float members, x_1, y_1, x_2 and
    y_2 which meant for some common cases we were having to copy out from an
    array into these members. We are now able to simply point into the users
    array avoiding a copy which seems desirable when submiting lots of
    rectangles.

    APIs they have now been changed to use the cogl_handle_ref/unref API

    cogl: improves header and coding style consistency
    
    We've had complaints that our Cogl code/headers are a bit "special" so
    this is a first pass at tidying things up by giving them some
    consistency. These changes are all consistent with how new code in Cogl
    is being written, but the style isn't consistently applied across all
    code yet.
    
    There are two parts to this patch; but since each one required a large
    amount of effort to maintain tidy indenting it made sense to combine the
    changes to reduce the time spent re indenting the same lines.
    
    The first change is to use a consistent style for declaring function
    prototypes in headers. Cogl headers now consistently use this style for
    prototypes:
    
     return_type
     cogl_function_name (CoglType arg0,
                         CoglType arg1);
    
    Not everyone likes this style, but it seems that most of the currently
    active Cogl developers agree on it.
    
    The second change is to constrain the use of redundant glib data types
    in Cogl. Uses of gint, guint, gfloat, glong, gulong and gchar have all
    been replaced with int, unsigned int, float, long, unsigned long and char
    respectively. When talking about pixel data; use of guchar has been
    replaced with guint8, otherwise unsigned char can be used.
    
    The glib types that we continue to use for portability are gboolean,
    gint{8,16,32,64}, guint{8,16,32,64} and gsize.
    
    The general intention is that Cogl should look palatable to the widest
    range of C programmers including those outside the Gnome community so
    - especially for the public API - we want to minimize the number of
    foreign looking typedefs.

    cogl: deprecates cogl_check_extension
    
    OpenGL is an implementation detail for Cogl so it's not appropriate to
    expose OpenGL extensions through the Cogl API.
    
    Note: Clutter is currently still using this API, because it is still
    doing raw GL calls in ClutterGLXTexturePixmap, so this introduces a
    couple of (legitimate) build warnings while compiling Clutter.

    never presume queuing redraws on invisible actors is redundant
    
    This replaces code like this:
      if (CLUTTER_ACTOR_IS_VISIBLE (self))
        clutter_actor_queue_redraw (self);
    with:
      clutter_actor_queue_redraw (self);
    
    clutter_actor_queue_redraw internally knows what can be optimized when
    the actor is not visible, but it also knows that the queue_redraw signal
    must always be sent in case a ClutterClone is cloning a hidden actor.

    box: port a ClutterGroup::foreach fix to ClutterBox
    
    ClutterGroup::foreach was recently changed (ref: ce030a3fce) to use
    g_list_foreach() to iterate the children instead of manually iterating
    the list so it would safely handle calls like:
    
      clutter_container_foreach (container, clutter_actor_destroy);
    
      (In this example clutter_actor_destroy will result in the current
       list item being iterated being freed.)

    group: make it comparable to ClutterBox
    
    There is a lot of duplication between ClutterGroup and ClutterBox so
    this makes the two files diff-able so that new fixes can easily be
    ported to both and bug fixes missing in one or the other can be spotted
    more easily. This doesn't change the behaviour of either actor; it's
    really just a shuffle around of code and normalizes the coding style to
    make the files comparable.
    
    This has already uncovered one bug in ClutterBox, and also highlights
    a bug in ClutterGroup + many other actors:
    
    1) ClutterGroup::real_foreach was recently changed to use
       g_list_foreach instead of manually iterating the child list so it can
       safely handle calls like:
         clutter_container_foreach (container, clutter_actor_destroy);
       ClutterBox is still manually iterating the list.
    
    2) In ClutterGroup we guard _queue_redraw() calls like this:
        if (CLUTTER_ACTOR_IS_VISIBLE (container))
    	clutter_actor_queue_redraw (CLUTTER_ACTOR (container));
       In ClutterBox we don't:
         I think ClutterBox is correct here because
         clutter_actor_queue_redraw already optimizes the case where the
         actor's not visible, but it also considers that the actor may be
         cloned and so the guard in ClutterGroup could break clones. This
         actually highlights a wider clutter bug since the same kinds of
         guards can be found in all other clutter actors.

    The signbit macro is defined in C99 so it should be available but some
    versions of GCC don't appear to define it by default. If it's not
    available we can use a hack to test the bit directly.

    depend on GLX 1.3 features, we still have to support drivers that report
    GLX 1.2 because there are a lot of mesa drivers out there incorrectly
    report GLX 1.2 even though they export extensions that depend on GLX
    1.3)

    glx backend: Adds support for GLX_INTEL_swap_event
    
    If your OpenGL driver supports GLX_INTEL_swap_event that means when
    glXSwapBuffers is called it returns immediatly and an XEvent is sent when
    the actual swap has finished.
    
    Clutter can use the events that notify swap completion as a means to
    throttle rendering in the master clock without blocking the CPU and so it
    should help improve the performance of CPU bound applications.

    modification is done from inline assembler.

    docs: Clean up the unused symbols for Cogl
    
    Gtk-doc is reporting a lot of false positives in the unused text file,
    mostly because of new private files that have been added to Cogl but not
    to the gtk-doc ignore list for the Cogl API reference.
    
    Once the false positives have been removed we have a couple of really
    missing symbols that should be added to the cogl-sections.txt file.

    docs: Move some Cogl defines in the private section
    
    The PixelFormat bit and mask #defines should not be used and are there
    mostly for convenience, so we can push them to the "private" sub-section
    of the API reference.
    
    This pushed Cogl's API reference coverage to 100%.

    conform: fix stack corruption in test-behaviours.c
    
    The test was calling g_object_get to fetch the "opacity-start" property
    (unsigned int) into a guint8 local variable. It's a bit of a mean trap
    given that the getter function returns guint8 values so this also adds a
    comment explaining what's going on.

    cogl-texture-2d: Use _cogl_texture_driver_gen to generate the GL tex
    
    _cogl_texture_driver_gen is needed to set the texture minification
    mode to Cogl's default of GL_LINEAR. There was also a line to set this
    in _cogl_texture_2d_new_with_size but it wasn't working because it was
    called *before* the texture was bound. If the texture was later
    rendered with the default material it then it would end up with GL's
    default mipmap filtering mode but without mipmaps so it would render
    white squares instead.

    cogl: Use SSE2 when possible for premultiplying
    
    This adds a fast path for premultiplying an RGBA image using SSE2
    instructions. SSE registers are 128-bit and we need at least 16-bits
    per component for the intermediate result of the multiplication so we
    can do two pixels in parallel with one register. The function
    interleaves 2 SSE registers to multiply 4 pixels in one function call
    with the hope that this will pipeline better.

    cogl-pixel-buffer: Add a fallback path
    
    First, let's add a new public feature called, surprisingly,
    COGL_FEATURE_PBOS to check the availability of PBOs and provide a
    fallback path when running on older GL implementations or on OpenGL ES
    
    In case the underlying OpenGL implementation does not provide PBOs, we
    need a fallback path (a malloc'ed buffer). The CoglPixelBufer
    constructors will instanciate a subclass of CoglBuffer that handles
    map/unmap and set_data() with a malloc'ed buffer.
    
    The public feature is useful to check before using set_data() on a
    buffer as it will mean doing a memcpy() when not supporting PBOs (in
    that case, it's better to create the texture directly instead of using a
    CoglBuffer).

    cogl-pixel-buffer: add a pixel buffer object class
    
    This subclass of CoglBuffer aims at wrapping PBOs or other system
    surfaces like DRM buffer objects. Two constructors are available:
    
    cogl_pixel_buffer_new() with a size when you only care about the size of
    the buffer (such a buffer can be used to store several texture data such
    as the three planes of a I420 frame).
    
    cogl_pixel_buffer_new_full() is more a 1:1 mapping between the data and
    an underlying surface, with the possibility of having access to a low
    level memory buffer that may have a stride.

    cogl-buffer: add an abstract class around openGL's buffer objects
    
    Buffer objects are cool! This abstracts the buffer API first introduced
    by GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object and then extended to other objects.
    
    The coglBuffer abstract class is intended to be the base class of all
    the buffer objects, letting the user map() buffers. If the underlying
    implementation does not support buffer objects (or only support VBO but
    not FBO for instance), fallback paths should be provided.

    cogl: new textures sould have GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER set to GL_LINEAR
    
    The only way the user has to set the mipmap filters is through the
    material/layer API. This API defaults to GL_LINEAR/GL_LINEAR for the max
    and min filters. With the main use case of cogl being 2D interfaces, it
    makes sense do default to GL_LINEAR for the min filter.
    
    When creating new textures, we did not set any filter on them, using
    OpenGL defaults': GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR for the min filter and
    GL_LINEAR for the max filter. This will make the driver allocate memory
    for the mipmap tree, memory that will not be used in the nominal case
    (as the material API defaults to GL_LINEAR).
    
    This patch tries to ensure that the min filter is set to GL_LINEAR
    before any glTexImage*() call is done on the texture by setting the
    filter when generating new OpenGL handles.

    The whole point of having the Animator class is that the developer can
    describe a complex animation using ClutterScript. Hence, ClutterAnimator
    should hook into the Script machinery and parse a specific description
    format for its keys.

    animator: Allow retrieving type property type from a key
    
    When asking a key for its target value we also ask the developer to pass
    in an initialized GValue - but we don't make it easy to know the type of
    the GValue. A developer has to ask the GObject class for the GParamSpec
    and then initialize the GValue, instead.
    
    Since we know the type of the GValue we should provide a getter for it.
    
    We should also allow developers to throw at us GValue with compatible and
    transformable types.
    
    Finally, all the accessors should be constified.

    script: Use a node when resolving an animation mode
    
    Instead of taking a string and duplicating the "is it a string or an
    integer" check in both Alpha and Animation, the function in
    ClutterScript that resolves the animation mode values should take a
    JsonNode and do all the checks it needs.

    cogl path: make sure marking the clip state dirty takes affect
    
    When we trashed the contents of the stencil buffer during
    _cogl_path_fill_nodes we marked the clip stack state as dirty and expected
    the clip stack code would clean up our glStencilFunc state.
    
    The problem is that we only try and update the clip state during
    _cogl_journal_init (when we flush the framebuffer state) which is only
    called when the journal first gets something logged in it.
    
    To make sure the stencil state is cleaned up we now also flush the journal
    so _cogl_journal_init will be called for the next logged rectangle.

    clutter-master-clock: Don't wait for a frame if time goes backwards
    
    If we aren't syncing to vblank or if the last dispatch didn't cause a
    redraw then the master clock will try to wait at least a small amount
    of time before dispatching again. However if time goes backwards then
    it would not do a dispatch until time catches up again. To fix this it
    know just runs a dispatch immediately if time goes backwards.
    
    This is related to Moblin bug #3839. There was a similar fix for this
    in 9dc012c07, however that only fixed the case where timelines
    wouldn't update. If there are no animations running then the master
    clock won't even try updating timelines until time catches up.

    Add ClutterAnimator
    
    ClutterAnimator is a class for managing the animation of multiple
    properties of multiple actors over time with keyframing of values.
    
    The Animator class is meant to be used to effectively describe
    animations using the ClutterScript definition format, and to construct
    complex implicit animations from the ground up.

    [stage] Set default size correctly
    
    Due to the way the new sizing works, clutter stage must set its size in
    init (to maintain old behaviour) and the properties on the X11 stage
    must be initialised to 1x1 so that it actually goes ahead with the
    resize.
    
    Fixes stages that aren't user resizable and have no size set from
    appearing at 1x1.

    [x11] Don't set actor size on ConfigureNotify
    
    Calling clutter_actor_set_size in response to ConfigureNotify makes
    setting the size of the stage racy - the most common result of which
    seems to be that you can't set the stage dimensions to anything less
    than 640x480.
    
    Instead, add a first_allocation bit to the private structure of the X11
    stage and force the first resize (necessary or the default stage will be
    a 1x1 window).

    Merge branch 'more-texture-backends'
    
    This adds three new texture backends.
    
    - CoglTexture2D: This is a trimmed down version of CoglTexture2DSliced
      which only supports a single texture and only works with the
      GL_TEXTURE_2D target. The code is a lot simpler so it has a less
      overheads than dealing with slices. Cogl will use this wherever
      possible.
    
    - CoglSubTexture: This is used to get a CoglHandle to represent a
      subregion of another texture. The texture can be used as if it was a
      standalone texture but it does not need to copy the resources.
    
    - CoglAtlasTexture: This collects RGB and RGBA textures into a single
      GL texture with the aim of reducing texture state changes and
      increasing batching. The backend will try to manage the atlas and
      may move the textures around to close gaps in the texture. By
      default all textures will be placed in the atlas.

    The reason why we have a dummy, offscreen Window when we create the

    features if it's not made current to a Drawable. Maybe in the future
    it will allow us to do so, but right now we have to make do with what
    GLX offers us.

    The Cogl atlas code was using _cogl_texture_prepare_for_upload with a
    NULL pointer for the dst_bmp to determine the internal format of the
    texture without converting the bitmap. It needs to do this to decide
    whether the texture will go in the atlas before wasting time on the
    conversion. This use of the function is a little confusing so that
    part of it has been split out into a new function called
    _cogl_texture_determine_internal_format. The code to decide whether a
    premult conversion is needed has also been split out.

    Remove the SDL backend
    
    The SDL API is far too limited for the windowing system needs of
    Clutter; the status of the SDL backend was always experimental, and
    since the Windows platform is supported by a native backend there is
    no point in having the SDL backend around any more.

    win32: Use a dummy window to support delayed stage creation
    
    The Win32 backend now implements the create_context method which
    creates a context and binds it to a 1x1 invisible window. That way
    there will always be a context bound and the features can be retrieved
    without creating the default stage. This reflects the changes in
    1c6ffc8..b245d55 to the GLX backend.

    stage: Create the default stage on demand
    
    Instead of creating the default stage during initialization we can
    now safely create it whenever clutter_stage_get_default() is called.
    
    To maintain the invariant, the default stage is immediately realized
    by Clutter itself.

    glx: Create the dummy Window with the GLX context
    
    Since we must guarantee that Cogl has a GL context to query, it is too
    late to use the "dummy Window" trick from within the get_features()
    virtual function implementation.
    
    Instead, we can create a dummy Window from create_context() itself and
    leave it around - basically trading a default stage with a dummy X
    window.
    
    We need to have the dummy X window around all the time so that the
    GLX context can be selected and made current.

    cogl-vertex-buffer: Refix disabling texture coord arrays
    
    Commit 92a375ab4 changed the initial value of max_texcoord_attrib_unit
    to -1 so that it could disable the texture coord array for the first
    texture unit when there are no texture coords used in the vbo. However
    max_texcoord_attrib_unit was an unsigned value so this actually became
    G_MAXUINT. The disabling loop at the bottom still worked because
    G_MAXUINT+1==0 but the check for whether any texture unit is greater
    than max_texcoord_attrib_unit was failing so it would always end up
    disabling all texture units. This is now fixed by changing
    max_texcoord_attrib_unit to be signed.

    string.
    
    Also, some freeze_notify() are called too early, leading to decoupling

    docs: Clarify Group's sizing semantics
    
    The documentation for ClutterGroup behaviour when setting an explicit
    size is not accurate - or, actually, it was accurate by the time
    ClutterGroup was first written but has been neglected in the following
    release cycles.
    
    To avoid confusion for new users of Clutter the documentation should be
    slightly expanded, mentioning the exact semantics of ClutterGroup with
    regards to: preferred size, explicitly set size and how to constrain the
    visible area of a ClutterGroup to an explicitly set size.

    tests: Add an initial Behaviour conformance suite
    
    The coverage of the Behaviour sub-classes is currently abysmal. An
    initial test suite for Behaviours should at least verify that the
    accessors and the constructors are doing the right thing.
    
    This initial test suite just verifies the BehaviourOpacity sub-class,
    but it already bumps up the overall coverage by 2%.

    event: Unify the off-stage motion events delivery behaviour
    
    When we disable the per-actor events delivery Clutter replicates the X11
    implicit soft grab for motion events with off-stage. The implicit grab
    is done whenever the pointer of a device leaves a window with a button
    still pressed; with the implicit grab in place the window still receives
    motion events even after the LeaveNotify - until the button is released.
    
    The implicit grab is not honoured in the per-actor event deliver case,
    though, so we have a mismatch between two in theory equivalent cases.
    
    Luckily, the fix is pretty trivial: when we check for a motion event
    with a stage set but without an actor set, and that has off-stage
    coordinates, we arbitrarily set the source to be the stage of the event
    and emit the pointer event.

    cogl: Let GL do the format conversion when uploading texture data
    
    Cogl accepts a pixel format for both the data in memory and the
    internal format to be used for the texture. If they do not match then
    it would convert them using the CoglBitmap functions before uploading
    the data. However, GL also lets you specify both formats so it makes
    more sense to let GL do the conversion. The driver may need the
    texture in a specific format so it may end up being converted anyway.
    
    The cogl_texture_upload_data functions have been removed and replaced
    with a single function to prepare the bitmap. This will only do the
    premultiplication conversion because that is the only part that GL
    can't do directly.

    cogl: Do the premult conversion in-place rather than copying to a new buffer
    
    The premult part of _cogl_convert_premult has now been split out as
    _cogl_convert_premult_status. _cogl_convert_premult has been renamed
    to _cogl_convert_format to make it less confusing. The premult
    conversion is now done in-place instead of copying the
    buffer. Previously it was copying the buffer once for the format
    conversion and then copying it again for the premult conversion. The
    premult conversion never changes the size of the buffer so it's quite
    easy to do in place. We can also use the separated out function
    independently.

    cogl-atlas-texture: Use a single atlas for both RGB and RGBA textures
    
    The internal format of the atlas texture is still set to the
    appropriate format so Cogl will disable blending for textures that are
    intended to be RGB. This should end up ignoring the alpha channel from
    the texture in the atlas. This makes the code slightly easier to
    maintain and should also improve the chances of batching.

    Since we're allowing allocation cycles saying that calling

    Fix problems with "position" and "selection-bound" change notification
    
    Added a "selection-bound" notify on clutter_text_clear_selection as it
    changes the value.
    
    Added utility function clutter_text_set_positions, in order to
    change both cursor position and selection bound inside a
    g_object_[freeze/thaw]_notify block
    
    Added g_object_[freeze/thaw]_notify in other functions that changes
    both cursor position and selection bound

    stage: Add :key-focus property
    
    ClutterStage has both set_key_focus() and get_key_focus() methods, but
    there is no :key-focus property. This means that it is not possible to
    get notifications when the key-focus has changes except by connecting to
    both the ::key-focus-in and ::key-focus-out signals and do additional
    bookkeeping.

    cogl: Use the colours of COGL_DEBUG=rectangles to debug batching
    
    Instead of assigning a new colour to each quad of a batch, the
    rectangle debugging code now assigns a new colour to each batch so
    that it can be used to visually see what is being batched. The colour
    is stored in a global variable that is reset during cogl_clear. This
    improves the chances that the same colour will be used for a batch in
    the next frames to avoid flickering.

    cogl-vertex-buffer: Fix disabling the texture arrays from previous prim
    
    When setting up the state for the vertex buffer,
    enable_state_for_drawing_buffer tries to keep track of the highest
    numbered texture unit in use. It then disables any texture arrays for
    units that were previously enabled if they are greater than that
    number. However if there is no texturing in the VBO then the max used
    unit would be left at 0 which it would later think meant unit 0 is
    still in use so it wouldn't disable it. To fix this it now initialises
    the max used unit to -1 which it should interpret as ‘no units are in
    use’ so it will later disable the arrays for all units.
    
    Thanks to Jon Mayo for reporting the bug.

    cogl: Fix checks of the number of available texture units
    
    We were checking the number of texture units against the GL enum that is
    used in glGetInteger() to query that number. Let's abstract this in a
    little function.
    
    Took the opportunity to dig a bit on the usage of GL limits for the
    number of texture (image) units and document our use of them. We'll need
    something finer grained if we want to fully exploit texture image units
    with a programmable pipeline.

    test-cogl-multitexture: use several materials with texture matrices
    
    A small doubt has risen about the use of CoglTextureUnit in materials:
    will texture matrices still work if we have several materials, each of
    them having at texture on the same texture unit? The answer is yes!
    
    test-cogl-multitexture has been extended to use 2 materials with about
    the same setup except a little difference: the texture matrices for the
    lightmaps rotate in opposite directions.
    
    While at it, changed the rotation behaviour by an implicit animation
    with a small additional bonus bling.

    cogl: Create CoglTextureUnit with its associated unit number
    
    The index field of CoglTextureUnit was never set, leading to the
    creation of units with index set to 0. When trying to retrieve a texture
    unit by its index (!= 0) with _cogl_get_texture_unit(), a new one was
    created as it could not find it back in the list of textures units:
    ctx->texture_units.

    actor: Use GParamSpecUint for :opacity
    
    The :opacity property is defined using a GParamSpecUchar. This usually
    leads to issues with language bindings that don't have an 'unsigned
    char' type and that need to explicitly handle the conversion between
    G_TYPE_UCHAR and G_TYPE_INT or G_TYPE_UINT.
    
    The property definition already specifies an interval size of [0, 255]
    on the values; more importantly, GObject already implicitly transforms
    between G_TYPE_UCHAR and G_TYPE_UINT (the GValue transformation
    functions are registered at type system initialization time) so
    switching between a GParamSpecUchar and a GParamSpecUint should not be
    an ABI break.
    
    I have tested a simple program using the opacity property before and
    after the change and I cannot see any run-time warnings related to this
    issue.

    animation: Transform if necessary
    
    The Animation code does transformation of values between type A and A'
    after checking for compatibility using g_value_type_compatible(). This
    is incorrect: compatibility means that the two types can be copied. The
    correct conversion should follow:
    
            if (compatible (type (A), type (A')))
              copy (A, A');
            else
              if (transformable (type (A), type (A')))
                transform (A, A');
              else
                error("Unable to trasform type A in A'");
    
    The transformation might still fail, so we need to check for errors
    there as well as a fall-through case.

    animation: Check for value transformability
    
    We should not just check for compatibility, but also for the ability to

    Usually compatibility is enough, especially if types can be
    introspected beforehand; some times, though, we also need to check for
    transformability as a type can provide the transformation functions
    necessary for the operation.

    master clock: Improve the timeline advancement protection
    
    The commit 1c69c61745ed510f0b6ab16cb963ca01994cb9fc which improved the
    protection against timeline removals during the master clock advancement
    was only doing half the job - and actually broke the chaining of
    animations inside the ::completed signal.
    
    We cannot simply take a reference on the timelines and still use the list
    held by the master clock because the do_tick() might result in the
    creation of a new timeline, which gets added at the end of the list with
    no reference increase and thus gets disposed at the end of the iteration.
    
    We also cannot steal the master clock timelines list because a timeline
    might be removed as the direct result of do_tick() and remove_timeline()
    would not find the timeline, failing and leaving a dangling pointer
    behind.
    
    For this reason we copy the list of timelines out of the one that the
    Master Clock holds, take a reference on each timeline, advance them all,
    release the reference and free the list.

    x11: Always handle core device events before XI events
    
    The XI 1.0 layer is complementary to the X11 core devices handling; this
    means that core events will still be emitted for the core pointer and
    keyboard devices, and that secondary (floating) devices should be
    handled on top of that.
    
    Thus, the XI event handling code should be executed (if explicitly
    compiled in and enabled) if the core device events have not been parsed.
    
    Note: this is going away with XI2, which completely replaces both core and
    XI1 events.

    Even with XInput support we should always register core devices. This
    allows us to handle enter and leave events correctly on the Stage and
    to have a working XInput 1.x support in Clutter.

    win32: Experimental implementation of device support
    
    Mostly lifted from the core pointer and keyboard X11 backend support.
    
    The win32 backend registers two devices (a core pointer and a core
    keyboard) and assigns them to the event structure when doing the
    translation from native events to Clutter events.
    
    Thanks to: Samuel Degrande <Samuel.Degrande@lifl.fr> for testing this
    patch.

    device: Unset the cursor actor when leaving the stage
    
    When an InputDevice leaves a stage we set the stage member of
    InputDevice to NULL. We should also unset the cursor_actor (as the
    device is obviously not on an actor any more).
    
    When the device re-enters the Stage the ENTER/LEAVE event generation
    machinery will then be able to emit the ENTER event on the Stage.

    x11: Discard the LeaveNotify for off-stage ButtonRelease
    
    If the user presses a button on a pointer device and then moves out the
    Stage X11 will emit the following events:
    
      LeaveNotify ➔ MotionNotify ... ➔ ButtonRelease ➔ LeaveNotify
    
    The second LeaveNotify differs from the first by the state field.
    
    Unfortunately, ClutterCrossingEvent doesn't have a modifier_state field
    like other events, so we cannot provide a way for programmatically
    distinguishing them from a Clutter perspective. This is also an X11-ism
    we might not even want to replicate on every backend with sane
    enter/leave semantics.
    
    For this reason we should check inside the X11 event processing if the
    pointer device has already left the Stage and ignore the second
    LeaveNotify.

    Add ClutterDeviceManager
    
    The ClutterDeviceManager is a singleton object that behaves like the
    StageManager: it holds all input devices and notifies on addition and
    removal.

    test-cogl-npot-texture: Use the COGL_TEXTURE_NO_ATLAS flag
    
    If the texture is put in the atlas it won't be sliced whatever size it
    is so it negates the test. We can avoid this with the NO_ATLAS flag.

    cogl-atlas-texture: Don't create atlas textures with the premult bit
    
    Previously the atlas textures were being created with whatever format
    the first sub texture is in. Only three formats are supported so this
    only matters if the first texture is a premultiplied alpha
    texture. Instead it now masks out the premultiplied bit so that the
    textures are always either RGB_888 or RGBA_8888.

    win32: Use an invisible cursor when cursor-visible is FALSE
    
    The win32 backend now handles the WM_SETCURSOR message and sets a
    fully transparent cursor if the cursor-visible property has been
    cleared on the stage. The icon is stored in the library via a resource
    file. The instance handle for the DLL is needed to load the resource
    so there is now a DllMain function to grab the handle.

    Otherwise the paint handler will still be run for the subsequent
    tests. This ends up writing to the ‘state’ variable which used to be
    on the stack so it will end up corrupting some stack variable. This
    was causing test-cogl-premult to fail.

    cogl-atlas-texture: Fix premultiplied texture formats
    
    When uploading texture data it was just calling cogl_texture_set_data
    on the large texture. This would attempt to convert the data to the
    format of the large texture. All of the textures with alpha channels
    are stored together regardless of whether they are premultiplied so
    this was causing premultiplied textures to be unpremultiplied
    again. It now just uploads the data ignoring the premult bit of the
    format so that it only gets converted once.

    cogl-primitives: Ensure the mipmaps for a layer before logging quads
    
    With the atlas texture backend ensuring the mipmaps can make it become
    a completely different texture which will have different texture
    coordinates or may even be sliced. Therefore we need to ensure the
    mipmaps before deciding which quads to log in the journal. This adds a
    new private function to cogl-material which ensures the mipmaps if
    needed.

    cogl: Make CoglSubTexture only work for quad rendering
    
    The sub texture backend doesn't work well as a completely general
    texture backend because for example when rendering with cogl_polygon
    it needs to be able to tranform arbitrary texture coordinates without
    reference to the other coordintes. This can't be done when the texture
    coordinates are a multiple of one because sometimes the coordinate
    should represent the left or top edge and sometimes it should
    represent the bottom or top edge. For example if the s coordinates are
    0 and 1 then 1 represents the right edge but if they are 1 and 2 then
    1 represents the left edge.
    
    Instead the sub-textures are now documented not to support coordinates
    outside the range [0,1]. The coordinates for the sub-region are now
    represented as integers as this helps avoid rounding issues. The
    region can no longer be a super-region of the texture as this
    simplifies the code quite a lot.
    
    There are two new texture virtual functions:
    
    transform_quad_coords_to_gl - This transforms two pairs of coordinates
         representing a quad. It will return FALSE if the coordinates can
         not be transformed. The sub texture backend uses this to detect
         coordinates that require repeating which causes cogl-primitives
         to use manual repeating.
    
    ensure_non_quad_rendering - This is used in cogl_polygon and
         cogl_vertex_buffer to inform the texture backend that
         transform_quad_to_gl is going to be used. The atlas backend
         migrates the texture out of the atlas when it hits this.

    cogl-framebuffer: Return gboolean from try_creating_fbo
    
    When try_creating_fbo fails it returns 0 to report the error and if it
    succeeds it returns ‘flags’. However cogl_offscreen_new_to_texture
    also passes in 0 for the flags as the last fallback to create the fbo
    with nothing but the color buffer. In that case it will return 0
    regardless of whether it succeeded so the last fallback will always be
    considered a failure.
    
    To fix this it now just returns a gboolean to indicate whether it
    succeeded and the flags used for each attempt is assigned when passing
    the argument rather than from the return value of the function.
    
    Also if the only configuration that succeeded was with flags==0 then
    it would always try all combinations because last_working_flags would
    also be zero. To avoid this it now uses a separate gboolean to mark
    whether we found a successful set of flags.

    texture: Remove reading the texture data back in ::unrealize()
    
    Reading back the texture data in unrealize does not seem like a
    desirable feature any more, clutter has evolved a lot since it was
    implemented.
    
    What's wrong with it now:
    
      * It takes *a lot* of time to read the data back with glReadPixel(),
      * When several textures share the same CoglTexture, the same data can
        be read back multiple times,
      * If the underlying material uses multiple texture units, only the
        first one was copied back,
      * In ClutterCairoTexture, we end up having two separate copies of the
        data,
      * GL actually manages texture memory accross system/video memory
        for us!
    
    For all the reasons above, let's get rid of the glReadPixel() in
    Texture::unrealize()

    cogl-framebuffer: Add some missing GL defines
    
    Since 755cce33a7 the framebuffer code is using the GL enums
    GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT and GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16. These aren't available
    directly under GLES except with the OES suffix so we need to define
    them manually as we do with the other framebuffer constants.

    cogl: Remove the CGL_* defines
    
    These macros used to define Cogl wrappers for the GLenum values. There are
    now Cogl enums everywhere in the API where these were required so we
    shouldn't need them anymore. They were in the public headers but as
    they are not neccessary and were not in the API docs for Clutter 1.0
    it should be safe to remove them.

    stage: Add the delete-event signal
    
    Using the ::event signal to match the CLUTTER_DELETE event type (and
    block the stage destruction) can be costly, since it means checking
    every single event.
    
    The ::delete-event signal is similar in spirit to any other specialized
    signal handler dealing with events, and retains the same semantics.

    journal: Fixes logging of multiple sets of texture coordinates
    
    If a user supplied multiple groups of texture coordinates with
    cogl_rectangle_with_multitexture_coords() then we would repeatedly log only
    the first group in the journal.  This fixes that bug and adds a conformance
    test to verify the fix.

    Remove obsolete code from test-text
    
    The test-text "fake scrolling" code stopped working somewhere between
    0.8 and 0.9, with the new layout code. Instead of the ::cursor-event
    signal it should use an approach similar to the Scrollable interface in
    the Moblin User Experience toolkit.
    
    Right now, it makes sense to ignore this code entirely.

    cogl: Support multiple fallbacks in cogl_offscreen_new_to_texture()
    
    The Intel drivers in Mesa 7.6 (and possibly earlier versions) don't
    support creating FBOs with a stencil buffer but without a depth
    buffer. This reworks framebuffer allocation so that we try a number
    of fallback options before failing.
    
    The options we try in order are:
    - the same options that were sucessful last time if available
    - combined depth and stencil
    - separate depth and stencil
    - just stencil, no depth
    - just depth, no stencil
    - neither depth or stencil

    We weren't taking a reference on the texture to be used as the color buffer
    for offscreen rendering, so it was possible to free the texture leaving the

    profiling: Adds initial UProf accounting to Cogl
    
    This adds gives Cogl a dedicated UProf context which will be linked together
    with Clutter's context during clutter_init_real().
    
    Initial timers cover _cogl_journal_flush and _cogl_journal_log_quad
    
    You can explicitly ask for a report of Cogl statistics by exporting
    COGL_PROFILE_OUTPUT_REPORT=1 but since the context is linked with Clutter's
    the statisitcs will also be shown in the automatic Clutter reports.

    profiling: Allow limiting statisics just to picking
    
    This suspends and resumes all uprof timers and counters except while dealing
    with picking, so as to give more focused statistics.
    
    Be aware that there are still some issues with this profile option since
    there are a few special case counters and timers that shouldn't be
    suspended; noteably the frame counters are incorrect so the per frame stats
    can't be trusted.

    As we have for debugging, this adds the ability to control profiling flags
    either via the command line or an environment variable.
    
    The first option added is CLUTTER_PROFILE=disable-report
    
    This also changes the reporting to be opt-out so you don't need to export
    CLUTTER_PROFILE_OUTPUT_REPORT=1 to see a report but you can use
    CLUTTER_PROFILE=disable-report to disable it if desired.

    profiling: Adds initial UProf support across clutter
    
    UProf is a small library that aims to help applications/libraries provide
    domain specific reports about performance.  It currently provides high
    precision timer primitives (rdtsc on x86) and simple counters, the ability
    to link statistics between optional components at runtime and makes report
    generation easy.
    
    This adds initial accounting for:
    - Total mainloop time
    - Painting
    - Picking
    - Layouting
    - Idle time
    
    The timing done by uprof is of wall clock time. It's not based on stochastic
    samples we simply sample a counter at the start and end.  When dealing with
    the complexities of GPU drivers and with various kinds of IO this form of
    profiling can be quite enlightening as it will be able to represent where
    your application is blocking unlike tools such as sysprof.
    
    To enable uprof accounting you must configure Clutter with --enable-profile
    and have uprof-0.2 installed from git://git.moblin.org/uprof
    
    If you want to see a report of statistics when Clutter applications exit you
    should export CLUTTER_PROFILE_OUTPUT_REPORT=1 before running them.
    
    Just a final word of caution; this stuff is new and the manual nature of
    adding uprof instrumentation means it is prone to some errors when modifying
    code.  This just means that when you question strange results don't rule out
    a mistake in the instrumentation.  Obviously though we hope the benfits out
    weigh e.g.  by focusing on very key stats and by having automatic reporting.

    x11: Switch back to RGB visuals by default
    
    Since asking for ARGB by default is still somewhat experimental on X11
    and not every toolkit or complex widgets (like WebKit) still do not like
    dealing with ARGB visuals, we should switch back to RGB by default - now
    that at least we know it works.
    
    For applications (and toolkit integration libraries) that want to enable
    the ClutterStage:use-alpha property there is a new function:
    
      void clutter_x11_set_use_argb_visual (gboolean use_argb);
    
    which needs to be called before clutter_init().
    
    The CLUTTER_DISABLE_ARGB_VISUAL environment variable can still be used
    to force this value off at run-time.

    actor: Just emit a relayout cycle warning
    
    Currently, ClutterActor detects a relayout cycle (an actor causing a
    relayout to be queued from within an allocate() function) and aborts
    after printing out a warning. This might be a little bit too anal
    retentive, and it currently breaks GTK+ embedding inside clutter-gtk
    so we should probably relax the behaviour a bit. Now we just emit the
    warning but we still go ahead with the relayout.

    Don't set the GLX_TRANSPARENT_TYPE attribute to choose an FBConfig
    
    When Clutter tries to pick an ARGB visual it tried to set the
    GLX_TRANSPARENT_TYPE attribute of the FBConfig to
    GLX_TRANSPARENT_RGB. However the code to do this was broken so that it
    was actually trying to set the non-existant attribute number 0x8008
    instead. Mesa silently ignored this so it appeared as if it was
    working but the Nvidia drivers do not like it.
    
    It appears that the TRANSPARENT_TYPE attribute is not neccessary for
    getting an ARGB visual anyway and instead it is intended to support
    color-key transparency. Therefore we can just remove it and get all of
    the FBConfigs. Then if we need an ARGB visual we can just walk the
    list to look for one with depth == 32.
    
    The fbconfig is now stored in a single variable instead of having a
    separate variable for the rgb and rgba configs because the old code
    only ever retrieved one of them anyway.

    text: Store the markup attributes separately
    
    Previously when the markup property is set it would generate an
    attribute list from the markup and then merge it with the attributes
    from the attribute property and store it as the effective
    attributes. The markup attributes and the marked up text would then be
    forgotten. This breaks if the application then later changes the
    attributes property because it would try to regenerate the effective
    attributes from the markup text but the stored text no longer contains
    any markup. If the original markup text happened to contain entities
    like '&lt;' they would end up causing parse errors because they would
    be converted to the actual symbols.
    
    To fix this the attributes from the markup are now stored
    independently from the effective attributes. The effective attributes
    are now regenerated if either set of attributes changes right before a
    layout is created.

    script: Copy the JSON node in PropertyInfo
    
    PropertyInfo should store a copy of the JsonNodes it references, so
    that property_info_free() can safely dispose them, and we can reference
    values across different UI definition data.
    
    The implicit timeline parsing code is not copying the JsonNode; this
    leads to a double free in some cases, which is masked by the GSlice
    allocator and produces a heap corruption later on.

    master-clock: Take a reference before advancing timelines
    
    A timeline advancement might cause another timeline to be
    destroyed, which will likely lead to a segmentation fault.
    
    Before advancing the timelines we should take a reference
    on them - just like we do for the stages before doing
    event processing. This will prevent dispose() from running
    until the end of the advancement.

    box-layout: Remove the allocations hash table
    
    The BoxLayout uses a HashTable to map the latest stable allocation of
    each child, in order to use that as the initial value during an
    animation; this in spite of already having a perfectly valid per-child
    storage as part of the layout manager: ClutterBoxChild.
    
    The last stable allocation should be stored inside the ClutterBoxChild
    instead of having it in the private data for ClutterBoxLayout. The
    access remains O(1), since there is a 1:1 mapping between child and
    BoxChild instances, but we save a little bit of memory and we avoid
    keeping aroud allocations for old children.

    actor: Add internal child flag
    
    ClutterActor checks, when destroying and reparenting, if the parent
    actor implements the Container interface, and automatically calls the
    remove() method to perform a clean removal.
    
    Actors implementing Container, though, might have internal children;
    that is, children that are not added through the Container API. It is
    already possible to iterate through them using the Container API to
    avoid breaking invariants - but calling clutter_actor_destroy() on
    these children (even from the Container implementation, and thus outside
    of Clutter's control) will either lead to leaks or to segmentation
    faults.
    
    Clutter needs a way to distinguish a clutter_actor_set_parent() done on
    an internal child from one done on a "public" child; for this reason, a
    push/pop pair of functions should be available to Actor implementations
    to mark the section where they wish to add internal children:
    
      ➔ clutter_actor_push_internal ();
        ...
        clutter_actor_set_parent (child1, parent);
        clutter_actor_set_parent (child2, parent);
        ...
      ➔ clutter_actor_pop_internal ();
    
    The set_parent() call will automatically set the newly added
    INTERNAL_CHILD private flag on each child, and both
    clutter_actor_destroy() and clutter_actor_unparent() will check for the
    flag before deciding whether to call the Container's remove method.

    box-layout: Add knobs for controlling animations
    
    ClutterLayoutManager does not have any state associated with it, and
    defers all the state to its sub-classes.
    
    The BoxLayout is thus in charge of controlling:
    
      • whether or not animations should be used
      • the duration of the animation
      • the easing mode of the animation
    
    By adding three new properties:
    
      • ClutterBoxLayout:use-animations
      • ClutterBoxLayout:easing-duration
      • ClutterBoxLayout:easing-mode
    
    And their relative accessors pairs we can make BoxLayout decide whether
    or not, and with which parameters, call the begin_animation() method of
    ClutterLayoutManager.
    
    The test-box-layout has been modified to reflect this new functionality,
    by checking the key-press event for the 'a' key symbol to toggle the use
    of animations.

    layout: Add animation support to LayoutManager
    
    In order to animate a fluid layout we cannot use the common animation
    code paths as they will override the size request and allocation paths
    that are handled by the layout manager itself.
    
    One way to introduce animations in the allocation sequence is to use a
    Timeline and an Alpha to compute a progress value and then use that
    value to interpolate an ActorBox between the initial and final states of
    the animation - with the initial state being the last allocation of the
    child prior to the animation start, and the final state the allocation
    of the child at the end; for every frame of the Timeline we then queue a
    relayout on the layout manager's container, which will result in an
    animation.
    
    ClutterLayoutManager is the most likely place to add a generic API for
    beginning and ending an animation, as well as the place to provide a
    default code path to create the ancillary Timeline and Alpha instances
    needed to drive the animation.
    
    A LayoutManager sub-class will need to:
    
      • call clutter_layout_manager_begin_animation() whenever it should
        animate between two states, for instance: whenever a layout property
        changes value;
      • eventually override begin_animation() and end_animation() in case
        further state needs to be set up, and then chain up to the default
        implementation provided by LayoutManager;
      • if a completely different implementation is required, the layout
        manager sub-class should override begin_animation(), end_animation()
        and get_animation_progress().
    
    Inside the allocate() implementation the sub-class should also
    interpolate between the last known allocation of a child and the newly
    computed allocation.

    Add ActorBox animation methods
    
    ClutterActorBox should have an interpolate() method that allows to
    compute the intermediate values between two states, given a progress
    value, e.g.:
    
            clutter_actor_box_interpolate (start, end, alpha, &result);
    
    Another utility method, useful for layout managers, is a modifier
    that clamps the members of the actor box to the nearest integer
    value.

    Add clutter_get_current_event
    
    When getting signals from higher level toolkits, occasionally
    one wants access to the underlying event; say for a Button
    widget's "clicked" signal, to get the keyboard state.
    
    Rather than having all of the highlevel widgets emit
    ClutterEvent just for the more unusual use cases,
    add a global function to access the event state.

    x11: Emulate XKB's detectable key auto-repeat
    
    Old-style X11 terminals require that even modern X11 send KeyPress
    and KeyRelease pairs when auto-repeating. For this reason modern(-ish)
    API like XKB has a way to detect auto-repeat and do a single KeyRelease
    at the end of a KeyPress sequence.
    
    The newly added check emulates XKB's detectable auto-repeat by peeking
    the next event after a KeyRelease and checking if it's a KeyPress for
    the same key and timestamp - and then ignoring the KeyRelease if it
    matches.

    actor: Add a NO_LAYOUT flag for actors
    
    Some actor implementation might avoid imposing any layout on their
    children. The Actor base class usually assumes some sort of layout
    management is in place, so it will queue relayouts when, for instance,
    an actor is shown or is hidden. If the parent of the actor does not
    impose any layout, though, showing or hiding one of its children will
    not affect the layout of the others.
    
    An example of this kind of container is ClutterGroup.
    
    By adding a new Actor flag, CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT, and by making
    the Group actor set it on itself, the Actor base class can now decide
    whether or not to queue a relayout. The flag is not meant to be used
    by application code, and should only be set when implementing a new
    container.

    cogl-material: Ensure mipmaps before doing anything else on a texture
    
    When the texture is in the atlas, ensuring the mipmaps can effectively
    make it become a completely different texture so we should do this
    before getting the GL handle.

    cogl-atlas-texture: Remove textures from the atlas when mipmapping is required
    
    Mipmaps don't work very well in the current atlas because there is not
    enough padding between the textures. If ensure_mipmaps is called it
    will now create a new texture and migrate the atlased texture to
    it. It will use the same blit mechanism as when migrating so it will
    try to use an FBO for a fast blit. However if this is not possible it
    will end up downloading the data for the entire atlas which is not
    ideal.

    cogl-atlas-texture: Try to do texture blits using an FBO
    
    When reorganizing the textures, we can avoid downloading the entire
    texture data if we bind the source texture in a framebuffer object and
    copy the destination using glCopyTexSubImage2D. This is also
    implemented using a much faster path in Mesa.
    
    Currently it is calling the GL framebuffer API directly but ideally it
    would use the Cogl offscreen API. However there is no way to tell Cogl
    not to create a stencil renderbuffer which seems like a waste in this
    situation.
    
    If FBOs are not available it will fallback to reading back the entire
    texture data as before.

    cogl-atlas-texture: Support reorganizing the atlas when it is full
    
    When space can't be found in the atlas for a new texture it will now
    try to reorganize the atlas to make space. A new CoglAtlas is created
    and all of the textures are readded in decreasing size order. If the
    textures still don't fit then the size of the atlas is doubled until
    either we find a space or we reach the texture size limits. If we
    successfully find an organization that fits then all of the textures
    will be migrated to a new texture. This involves copying the texture
    data into CPU memory and then uploading it again. Potentially it could
    eventually use a PBO or an FBO to transfer the image without going
    through the CPU.
    
    The algorithm for laying out the textures works a lot better if the
    rectangles are added in order so we might eventually want some API for
    creating multiple textures in one go to avoid reorganizing the atlas
    as far as possible.

    cogl: Add an atlased texture backend
    
    This adds a CoglAtlas type which is a data structure that keeps track
    of unused sub rectangles of a larger rectangle. There is a new atlased
    texture backend which uses this to put multiple textures into a single
    larger texture.
    
    Currently the atlas is always sized 256x256 and the textures are never
    moved once they are put in. Eventually it needs to be able to
    reorganise the atlas and grow it if necessary. It also needs to
    migrate the textures out of the atlas if mipmaps are required.

    Add a cache of size requests
    
    clutter_actor_get_preferred_width/height currently caches only one size
    requests, for a given height / width.
    
    It's common for a layout manager to call get_preferred_width with 2
    different heights during the same allocation cycle. Typically once in
    the size request, once in the allocation. If
    clutter_actor_get_preferred_width is called
    alternatively with 2 different for_height, the cache is totally
    inefficient, and we end up always querying the actor size even
    when the actor does not need a re-allocation.

    cogl: Add a CoglTexture2D backend
    
    This is an optimised version of CoglTexture2DSliced that always deals
    with a single texture and always uses the GL_TEXTURE_2D
    target. cogl_texture_new_from_bitmap now tries to use this backend
    first. If it can't create a texture with that size then it falls back
    the sliced backend.
    
    cogl_texture_upload_data_prepare has been split into two functions
    because the sliced backend needs to know the real internal format
    before the conversion is performed. Otherwise the converted bitmap
    will be wasted if the backend can't support the size.

    cogl: Add a sub texture backend
    
    This adds a new texture backend which represents a sub texture of a
    larger texture. The texture is created with a reference to the full
    texture and a set of coordinates describing the region. The backend
    simply defers to the full texture for all operations and maps the
    coordinates to the other range. You can also use coordinates outside
    the range [0,1] to create a repeated version of the full texture.
    
    A new public API function called cogl_texture_new_from_sub_texture is
    available to create the sub texture.

    cogl: Make the callback for foreach_sub_texture_in_region use const
    
    The CoglTextureSliceCallback function pointer now takes const pointers
    for the texture coordinates. This makes it clearer that the callback
    should not modify the array and therefore the backend can use the same
    array for both sets of coords.

    cogl: Add a texture utility function for manually repeating
    
    Given a region of texture coordinates this utility invokes a callback
    enough times to cover the region with a subregion that spans the
    texture at most once. Eg, if called with tx1 and tx2 as 0.5 and 3.0 it
    it would invoke the callback with:
    
    0.5,1.0  1.0,2.0  2.0,3.0
    
    Manual repeating is needed by all texture backends regardless of
    whether they can support hardware repeating because when Cogl calls
    the foreach_sub_texture_in_region method then it sets the wrap mode to
    GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE and no hardware repeating is possible.

    cogl-primitives: Check for repeating after the coordinate transform
    
    In _cogl_multitexture_quad_single_primitive we use a wrap mode of
    GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE if the texture coordinates are all in the range [0,1]
    or GL_REPEAT otherwise. This is to avoid pulling in pixels from either
    side when using GL_LINEAR filter mode and rendering the entire
    texture. Previously it was checking using the unconverted texture
    coordinates. This is ok unless the texture backend is radically
    transforming the texture coordinates, such as in the sub texture
    backend where the coordinates may map to something completely
    different. We now check whether the coordinates are in range after
    converting them.

    cogl: Move all of the fields from CoglTexture to CoglTexture2DSliced
    
    Most of the fields that were previously in CoglTexture are specific to
    the implementation of CoglTexture2DSliced so they should be placed
    there instead. For example, the 'mipmaps_dirty' flag is an
    implementation detail of the ensure_mipmaps function so it doesn't
    make sense to force all texture backends to have this function.
    
    Other fields such as width, height, gl_format and format may make
    sense for all textures but I've added them as virtual functions
    instead. This may make more sense for a sub-texture backend for
    example where it can calculate these based on the full texture.

    cogl: Move data only used for upload out of CoglTexture
    
    The CoglTexture struct previously contained some fields which are only
    used to upload data such as the CoglBitmap and the source GL
    format. These are now moved to a separate CoglTextureUploadData struct
    which only exists for the duration of one of the cogl_texture_*_new
    functions. In cogl-texture there are utility functions which operate
    on this new struct rather than on CoglTexture directly.
    
    Some of the fields that were previously stored in the CoglBitmap
    struct are now copied to the CoglTexture such as the width, height,
    format and internal GL format.
    
    The rowstride was previously stored in CoglTexture and this was
    publicly accessible with the cogl_texture_get_rowstride
    function. However this doesn't seem to be a useful function because
    there is no need to use the same rowstride again when uploading or
    downloading new data. Instead cogl_texture_get_rowstride now just
    calculates a suitable rowstride from the format and width of the
    texture.

    cogl: Use #ifdef GL around GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB
    
    Commit 558b17ee1e added support for rectangle textures to the
    framebuffer code. Under GLES there is no GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB
    definition so this was breaking the build. The rest of Cogl uses
    ifdef's around that constant so we should do the same here.

    glx: Always request an ARGB visual
    
    When requesting the GLXFBConfig for creating the GLX context, we should
    always request one that links to an ARGB visual instead of a plain RGB
    one.
    
    By using an ARGB visual we allow the ClutterStage:use-alpha property to
    work as intended when running Clutter under a compositing manager.
    
    The default behaviour of requesting an ARGB visual can be disabled by
    using the:
    
      CLUTTER_DISABLE_ARGB_VISUAL
    
    Environment variable.

    Instead of creating stand-alone HTML files, use XSLT to transform the
    DocBook into a DevHelp file, so that we can read the Cookbook inside
    DevHelp -- just like the API reference.

    Add the Clutter Cookbook to the build
    
    The "Clutter Cookbook" is a document designed to contain solutions
    to common problems applications developers might encounter when using
    Clutter. It is meant as a companion to the API reference but it
    requires knowledge of the Clutter API and framework.

    layout-manager: Create LayoutMeta on demand
    
    The ClutterLayoutMeta instances should be created on demand, whenever
    the layout manager needs them - if the layout manager supports layout
    properties.
    
    This removes the requirement to call add_child_meta() and
    remove_child_meta() on add and remove respectively; it also simplifies
    the implementation of LayoutManager sub-classes since we can add
    fallback code in the base abstract class.
    
    Eventually, this will also lead to an easier to implement ClutterScript
    parser for layout properties.
    
    With the new scheme, the ClutterLayoutMeta instance is created whenever
    the layout manager tries to access it; if there isn't an instance
    already attached to the container's child, one is created -- assuming
    that the LayoutManager sub-class has overridden the
    get_child_meta_type() virtual function and it's returning a valid GType.
    
    We can also provide a default implementation for create_child_meta(),
    by getting the GType and instantiating a ClutterLayoutMeta with all the
    fields already set. If the layout manager requires more work then it can
    obviously override the default implementation (and even chain up to it).
    
    The ClutterBox actor has been updated, as well as the ClutterBoxLayout
    layout manager, to take advantage of the changes of LayoutManager.

    Use the correct colour when clearing the stage for picking
    
    The colour test for the stage in _clutter_do_pick checks for white to
    determine whether the stage was picked but since 47db7af4d we were
    setting the colur to black. This usually worked because the id of the
    default stage ends up being 0 which equates to black. However if a
    second stage is created then it will always end up picking the first
    stage.

    cogl: Enable blending if a lighting colour is semi-transparent
    
    We currently enable blending if the material colour has
    transparency. This patch makes it also enable blending if any of the
    lighting colours have transparency. Arguably this isn't neccessary
    because we don't expose any API to enable lighting so there is no
    bug. However it is currently possible to enable lighting with a direct
    call to glEnable and this otherwise works so it is a shame not to have
    it.

    cogl: deprecate cogl_draw_buffer API and replace with a cogl_framebuffer API
    
    cogl_push_draw_buffer, cogl_set_draw_buffer and cogl_pop_draw_buffer are now
    deprecated and new code should use the new cogl_framebuffer_* API instead.
    
    Code that previously did:
        cogl_push_draw_buffer ();
        cogl_set_draw_buffer (COGL_OFFSCREEN_BUFFER, buffer);
        /* draw */
        cogl_pop_draw_buffer ();
    should now be re-written as:
        cogl_push_framebuffer (buffer);
        /* draw */
        cogl_pop_framebuffer ();
    
    As can be seen from the example above the rename has been used as an
    opportunity to remove the redundant target argument from
    cogl_set_draw_buffer; it now only takes one call to redirect to an offscreen
    buffer, and finally the term framebuffer may be a bit more familiar to
    anyone coming from an OpenGL background.

    cogl: Use a vtable for the texture backends instead of a type and switch
    
    Instead of storing an enum with the backend type for each texture and
    then using a switch statement to decide which function to call, we
    should store pointers to all of the functions in a struct and have
    each texture point to that struct. This is potentially slightly faster
    when there are more backends and it makes implementing new backends
    easier because it's more obvious which functions have to be
    implemented.

    [cogl-material] Adds cogl_material_copy() API
    
    cogl_material_copy can be used to create a new CoglHandle referencing a copy
    of some given material.
    
    From now on we will advise that developers always aim to use this function
    instead of cogl_material_new() when creating a material that is in any way
    derived from another.
    
    By using cogl_material_copy, Cogl can maintain an ancestry for each material
    and keep track of "similar" materials.  The plan is that Cogl will use this
    information to minimize the cost of GPU state transitions.

    [cogl] remove unused gles/cogl-utils.[c,h]
    
    The only function in gles/cogl-utils.c was cogl_util_next_p2() and it's
    redundant since we also have a cogl/cogl-utils.[c,h]

    docs: Don't document cogl_flush_gl_state as public API
    
    This function was #if 0'd before we released Clutter 1.0 so there's no
    implementation of it.  At some point we thought it might assist with
    developers breaking out into raw OpenGL.  Breaking out to raw GL is a
    difficult problem though so we decided instead we will wait for a specific
    use case to arrise before trying to support it.

    animation: Keep a weak reference on actors
    
    Actors, unlike objects, can effectively go away whilst being
    animated - usually because of an explicit destoy().
    
    The Animation created by clutter_actor_animate() and friends
    should keep a weak reference on the actor and eventually
    get rid of the animation itself in case the actor goes away
    whilst being animated.

    Minor fix to cogl material
    
    _cogl_material_get_layer expects a CoglMaterial* pointer but it was
    being called with a CoglHandle. This doesn't matter because the
    CoglHandle is actually just the CoglMaterial* pointer anyway but it
    breaks the ability to change the _cogl_material_pointer_from_handle
    macro.

    build: Make cogl.h not conditional on driver defines
    
    The main COGL header cogl.h is currently created at configure time
    because it conditionally includes the driver-dependent defines. This
    sometimes leads to a stale cogl.h with old definitions which can
    break the build until you clean out the whole tree and start from
    scratch.
    
    We can generate a stable cogl-defines.h at build time from the
    equivalent driver-dependent header and let cogl.h include that
    file instead.

    ChangeLogs on dist.

    For VBOs, we don't need to check for the extension if the GL version

    We could also assume shader support in GL 2.0 except that the function
    names are different from those in the extension so it wouldn't work
    well with the current mechanism.

    cogl: Make it easier to add checks for GL extensions
    
    Previously if you need to depend on a new GL feature you had to:
    
    - Add typedefs for all of the functions in cogl-defines.h.in
    
    - Add function pointers for each of the functions in
      cogl-context-driver.h
    
    - Add an initializer for the function pointers in
      cogl-context-driver.c
    
    - Add a check for the extension and all of the functions in
      cogl_features_init. If the extension is available under multiple
      names then you have to duplicate the checks.
    
    This is quite tedious and error prone. This patch moves all of the
    features and their functions into a list of macro invocations in
    cogl-feature-functions.h. The macros can be redefined to implement all
    of the above tasks from the same header.
    
    The features are described in a struct with a pointer to a table of
    functions. A new function takes the feature description from this
    struct and checks for its availability. The feature can take a list of
    extension names with a list of alternate namespaces (such as "EXT" or
    "ARB"). It can also detect the feature from a particular version of
    GL.
    
    The typedefs are now gone and instead the function pointer in the Cogl
    context just directly contains the type.
    
    Some of the functions in the context were previously declared with the
    'ARB' extension. This has been removed so that now all the functions
    have no suffix. This makes more sense when the extension could
    potentially be merged into GL core as well.

    win32: Remove the check for GL 1.2
    
    Since 568c29ba4 the GL version is now validated further up in
    ClutterStage via Cogl so there is no need for the Win32 backend to do
    it.

    Use the GL_ARB_multitexture extension on GL 1.2
    
    Cogl requires multi-texturing support. This is only available as an
    extension in GL 1.2 so we should check for it before accepting the
    driver.

commit 568c29ba491e4a6b3bef426be528d7246110011c
Author: Neil Roberts <neil@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 11 13:26:54 2009 +0000

    Validate that the GL version is >= 1.2
    
    There is a new internal Cogl function called _cogl_check_driver_valid
    which looks at the value of the GL_VERSION string to determine whether
    the driver is supported. Clutter now calls this after the stage is
    realized. If it fails then the stage is marked as unrealized and a
    warning is shown.
    
    _cogl_features_init now also checks the version number before getting
    the function pointers for glBlendFuncSeparate and
    glBlendEquationSeparate. It is not safe to just check for the presence
    of the functions because some drivers may define the function without
    fully implementing the spec.
    
    The GLES version of _cogl_check_driver_valid just always returns TRUE
    because there are no version requirements yet.
    
    Eventually the function could also check for mandatory extensions if
    there were any.

    [cogl-primitives] Don't clear the whole stencil buffer
    
    When _cogl_add_path_to_stencil_buffer is used to draw a path we don't
    need to clear the entire stencil buffer. Instead it can clear just the
    bounding box of the path. This adds an extra parameter called
    'need_clear' which is only set if the stencil buffer is being used for
    clipping.

    Every actor should have a property for retrieving (and setting) the

    The text direction is used to provide a consisten behaviour in both
    left-to-right and right-to-left languages. For instance, ClutterText
    should perform key navigation following text direction. Layout
    managers should also take into account text direction to derive the

    osx: CGBitmapContextCreate can't make 24bpp, alphaless offscreen pixmaps
    
    While loading a JPEG from disk (with clutter_texture_new_from_file),
    I got the following:
    
    <Error>: CGBitmapContextCreate: unsupported parameter combination: 8
    integer bits/component; 24 bits/pixel; 3-component colorspace;
    kCGImageAlphaNone; 3072 bytes/row.
    <Error>: CGContextDrawImage: invalid context
    
    Looking around, I found that CGBitmapContextCreate can't make 24bpp
    offscreen pixmaps without an alpha channel...
    
    This fixes the bug, and seems to not break other things...

    tests: Remove a spurious #include
    
    The test-backface-culling has what looks like a stray #include in which
    stops the test compiling for backends without GdkPixbuf. Remove it.

    docs: Fix OS X docs to install Ports in correct order
    
    The order in which the MacPorts are installed is important otherwise we open
    the user up to a world of pain.
    This patch also tweaks the OS X docs to follow the formatting of the rest of
    the docs and to discuss the option of GtkDoc.

    osx: Implement the updated ClutterStageWindow interface
    
    In the new Clutter world backend stage implementations should be lightweight

    behaviour: Implement the implicit alpha parsing
    
    ClutterBehaviour should implement the Scriptable interface
    and parse ClutterAlpha when implicitly defined, instead of
    having this ad hoc code inside ClutterScriptParser itself.
    
    After all, only ClutterBehaviour supports Alpha defined
    implicitly.

    [cogl-clip] deprecate parts and cleanup the API
    
    cogl_clip_push() which accepts a rectangle in model space shouldn't have
    been defined to take x,y,width,height arguments because this isn't consistant
    with other Cogl API dealing with model space rectangles.  If you are using a
    coordinate system with the origin at the center and the y+ extending up,
    then x,y,width,height isn't as natural as (x0,y0)(x1,y1). This API has
    now been replace with cogl_clip_push_rectangle()
    
    (As a general note: the Cogl API should only use the x,y,width,height style
    when the appropriate coordinate space is defined by Cogl to have a top left
    origin.  E.g.  window coordinates, or potentially texture coordinates)
    
    cogl_clip_push_window_rect() shouldn't have been defined to take float
    arguments since we only clip with integral pixel precision. We also
    shouldn't have abbreviated "rectangle". This API has been replaced with
    cogl_clip_push_window_rectangle()
    
    cogl_clip_ensure() wasn't documented at all in Clutter 1.0 and probably
    no one even knew it existed. This API isn't useful, and so it's now
    deprecated. If no one complains we may remove the API altogether for
    Clutter 1.2.
    
    cogl_clip_stack_save() and cogl_clip_stack_restore() were originally added
    to allow us to save/restore the clip when switching to/from offscreen
    rendering.  Now that offscreen draw buffers are defined to own their clip
    state and the state will be automatically saved and restored this API is now
    redundant and so deprecated.

    [debug] Adds a COGL_DEBUG=force-scanline-paths
    
    For a long time now the GLES driver for Cogl has supported a fallback
    scanline rasterizer for filling paths when no stencil buffer is available,
    but now that we build the same cogl-primitives code for GL and GLES I
    thought it may sometimes be useful for debugging to force Cogl to use the
    scanline rasterizer instead of the current stencil buffer approach.

    tests: Clean up interactive test build
    
    The build for interactive tests creates symbolic links for the data
    under tests/data; it also uses symbolic links for creating "binaries"
    for each interactive test. This is less than ideal, though.
    
    Instead, the tests should build a path to the data files by using
    a pre-processor define like TESTS_DATADIR; both g_build_filename() and
    pre-processor string concatenation can be used to generate a valid
    file name with the full path to the files.
    
    The build system should also create wrapper scripts, just like we
    do inside the conformance test suite, to be able to launch single
    tests.

    script: Allow parsing child properties
    
    The ClutterScript parser needs to be extended to parse child properties
    and apply them after an actor has been added to a container. In order to
    distinguish child properties from regular GObject properties we can use
    the "child::" prefix, e.g.:
    
      {
        "type" : "ClutterRectangle",
        "id" : "child-01",
        "child::has-focus" : true,
        ...
      }
    
    Parsing child properties can be deferred to the ClutterScriptable
    interface, just like regular properties.

    script: Clean up Color parsing rules
    
    All the ClutterColor parsing rules should be coalesced inside
    clutter_script_parse_color(): object, array and string notations
    are the canonical ways of defining a ClutterColor inside a
    ClutterScript definition. Having a single function in charge of
    the parsing cleans up the code.

    script: Separate construction from properties application
    
    Currently, ClutterScriptParser will construct the object (using the
    construct-only and construct parameters), apply the properties from
    the ClutterScript definition, and eventuall will add children and
    behaviours.
    
    The construction phase should be more compartimentalized: the objects
    should be constructed first and eventual children and behaviours
    added. Then, once an object is requested or when the parsing process
    has terminated, all the properties should be applied.
    
    This change allows us to set up the actors before setting their
    non-construct properties.

    ClutterScript is a very complicated piece of machinery, with a
    parser that has custom variations on top of the basic JSON
    format; it could also be extended in the future, so if we don't
    want to introduce regressions or break existing ClutterScript
    definitions, we'd better have a conformance test suite.

    tests: Allow getting data files from the tests/data directory
    
    The units under the conformance test suite should be able to use
    external files. Linking the files in tests/conform like the
    interactive tests do seems like a hack piled on top of a hack, so
    instead we should provide a programmatic way for a conformance
    test unit to get the full path of a file, regardless of where the
    tests/data directory is.
    
    We can use a define to get the full path of tests/data and then
    a function using g_build_filename() to construct the path to the
    file we want.

    [test-fbo] greatly simplify the test
    
    This test tried to do too much, and I can't remember the last time I saw this
    test work.
    
    It no longer tries to create a texture from an offscreen actor and it no
    longer tries to use shaders.
    
    It does though show that chaining of clutter_texture_new_from_actor now
    works, and that animating the source actor is reflected in textures created
    from it.
    
    When run you should see three actors:
    - on the left is the pristine source actor rotating around the y-axis
    - in the middle is the first texture created from the source actor
    - and on the right a texture created from the middle actor
    
    Note: the somewhat strange bobbing of the middle and right textures is
    actually correct given how it was decided long ago to map the transformed
    (to screen space) allocation of the source actor to the texture.  When the
    hand spins around the perspective projection of the top of the hand results
    in the origin of the texture bobbing up to a higher stage position, but the
    position of the textures is fixed.  This design also means we end up
    reallocating our offscreen draw buffer every frame that the actors
    transformed size changes, which isn't ideal.

    [tests] test-backface-culling: test culling with offscreen rendering
    
    Since offscreen rendering is internally forced to be upside down Cogl
    needs to reverse the glFrontFace winding order so as not to interfere
    with the use of cogl_set_backface_culling_enabled()
    
    This ensures we test that mechanism.

    Unlike OpenGL Cogl puts the origin of windows/viewports at the top left
    instead of bottom left.  This test verifies that we correctly translate Cogl
    viewports to OpenGL viewports for the awkward cases where the given viewport
    has an offset and/or the viewport has a different size to the current draw
    buffer.

    Add a conformance test for clutter_texture_new_from_actor
    
    This contains four tests :-
    
     - A regular onscreen source with a clone next to it
    
     - An offscreen source with a clone. This is currently commented out
       because it no longer works.
    
     - An onscreen source with a rectangular clip and a clone.
    
     - An onscreen source with a clip from a path and a clone.
    
    The sources are all a 2x2 grid of colors. Each clone is tested that it
    either contains the color that should be at that grid position or that
    the stage color is showing through if the source is clipped.

    [texture] fix rounding when calculating update_fbo viewport offset
    
    When rendering to an fbo for supporting clutter_texture_new_from_actor we
    render to an fbo with the same size as the source actor, but with a viewport
    the same size as the stage.  We offset the viewport so when we render the
    source actor in its normal transformed stage position it lands on the fbo.
    Previously we were rounding the transformed position given as a float by
    truncating the fraction (just using a C cast) but that resulted in an
    incorrect pixel offset when rendering offscreen depending on the source
    position.
    
    We now simply + 0.5 before casting (or -0.5 for negative numbers)

    [texture] switch to a new design for handling offscreen rendering
    
    For supporting clutter_texture_new_from_actor(): when updating a
    ClutterTexture's fbo we previously set up an offset frustum in the
    perspective matrix before rendering source actors to an offscreen draw
    buffer so as to give a perspective as if it were being drawn at its
    original stage location.
    
    Now that Cogl supports offset viewports there is a simpler way...
    
    When we come to render the source actor to our offscreen draw buffer we
    now copy the projection matrix from the stage; we create a viewport
    that's also the same size as the stage (though larger than the offscreen
    draw buffer) and as before we apply the modelview transformations of
    the source actors ancestry before painting it.
    
    The only trick we need now is to offset the viewport according to the
    transformed (to screen space) allocation of the source actor (something we
    required previously too).  We negatively offset the stage sized viewport
    such that the smaller offscreen draw buffer is positioned to sit underneath
    the source actor in stage coordinates.

    [texture] push/pop draw buffer when painting actors to a texture
    
    When updating the FBO for a source actor (to support
    clutter_texture_new_from_actor()) we used to simply set an offscreen draw
    buffer to be current, paint the source actor and then explicitly set the
    window to be current again.  This precluded chaining texture_new_from_actor
    though because updating another FBO associated with a source actor would end
    up restoring the window as the current buffer instead of the previous
    offscreen buffer.  Now that we use Cogl's draw buffer stack; chaining
    clutter_texture_new_from_actor() should be possible.

    [cogl-draw-buffer] fix Cogl -> GL viewport coord conversion
    
    Before we call glViewport we need to convert Cogl viewport coordinates
    (where the origin is defined to be top left) to OpenGL coordinates
    (where the origin is defined to be bottom left)
    
    We weren't considering that offscreen rendering is always upside down
    and in this case Cogl coordinates == OpenGL coordinates.

    [cogl_clip_push_window_rect] fix Cogl -> GL coordinate conversion
    
    Firstly this now uses the draw buffer height not the viewport height
    when we need to perform a y = height - y conversion, since (as the
    name suggests) we are dealing with window coordinates not viewport
    coordinates.
    
    Secondly this skips any conversion when the current draw buffer is an
    offscreen draw buffer since offscreen rendering is always forced to be
    upside down and in this case Cogl window coordinates == GL window
    coordinates.

    [matrix] Adds cogl_matrix_get_inverse API
    
    This new API takes advantage of the recently imported Mesa code to support
    inverse matrix calculation.  The matrix code keeps track (via internal
    flags) of the transformations a matrix represents so that it can select an
    optimized inversion function.
    
    Note: although other aspects of the Cogl matrix API have followed a similar
    style to Cairo's matrix API we haven't added a cogl_matrix_invert API
    because the inverse of a CoglMatrix is actually cached as part of the
    CoglMatrix structure meaning a destructive API like cogl_matrix_invert
    doesn't let users take advantage of this caching design.

    [cogl-matrix] Import Mesa's matrix manipulation code
    
    This pulls in code from Mesa to improve our matrix manipulation support. It
    includes support for calculating the inverse of matrices based on top of a
    matrix categorizing system that allows optimizing certain matrix types.
    (the main thing we were after) but also adds some optimisations for
    rotations.
    
    Changes compared to the original code from Mesa:
    
    - Coding style is consistent with the rest of Cogl
    - Instead of allocating matrix->m and matrix->inv using malloc, our public
      CoglMatrix typedef is large enough to directly contain the matrix, its
      inverse, a type and a set of flags.
    - Instead of having a _math_matrix_analyse which updates the type, flags and
      inverse, we have _math_matrix_update_inverse which essentially does the
      same thing (internally making use of _math_matrix_update_type_and_flags())
      but with additional guards in place to bail out when the inverse matrix is
      still valid.
    - When initializing a matrix with the identity matrix we don't immediately
      initialize the inverse matrix; rather we just set the dirty flag for the
      inverse (since it's likely the user won't request the inverse of the
      identity matrix)

    [cogl] Use clockwise face winding for offscreen buffers with culling enabled
    
    Because Cogl defines the origin for texture as top left and offscreen draw
    buffers can be used to render to textures, we (internally) force all
    offscreen rendering to be upside down. (because OpenGL defines the origin
    to be bottom left)
    
    By forcing the users scene to be rendered upside down though we also reverse
    the winding order of all the drawn triangles which may interfere with the
    users use of backface culling.  This patch ensures that we reverse the
    winding order for a front face (if culling is in use) while rendering
    offscreen so we don't conflict with the users back face culling.

    OpenGL calls and Cogl provides a suitable alternative.  It also means
    read_pixels_to_file() doesn't need to manually flip the data read due to
    differences in Clutter/Cogl coordinate systems.

    [cogl_read_pixels] don't force a 4 byte pack alignment
    
    Technically this change shouldn't make a difference since we are
    calling glReadPixels with GL_RGBA GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE which is a 4
    byte format and it should always result in the same value according
    to how OpenGL calculates the location of sequential rows.
    
    i.e. k  = a/s * ceil(snl/a) where:
     a = alignment
     s = component size (1)
     n = number of components per pixel (4)
     l = number of pixels in a row
    gives:
    k = 4/1 * ceil(4l/4) and k = 1/1 * ceil(4l/1) which are equivalent
    
    I'm changing it because I've seen i915 driver code that bails out of
    hardware accelerated paths if the alignment isn't 1, and because
    conceptually we have no alignment constraints here so even if the current
    value has no effect, when we start reading back other formats it may upset
    things.

    [read-pixels] don't flip data when reading from offscreen draw buffers
    
    Since we do all offscreen rendering upside down (so that we can have the
    origin for texture coordinates be the top left of textures for the cases
    where offscreen draw buffers are bound to textures) we don't need to flip
    data read back from an offscreen framebuffer before we we return it to the

    cogl_viewport only accepted a viewport width and height, but there are times
    when it's also desireable to have a viewport offset so that a scene can be
    translated after projection but before hitting the framebuffer.

    [cogl] Make sure Cogl always knows the current window geometry
    
    Because Cogl defines the origin of viewport and window coordinates to be
    top-left it always needs to know the size of the current window so that Cogl
    window/viewport coordinates can be transformed into OpenGL coordinates.
    
    This also fixes cogl_read_pixels to use the current draw buffer height
    instead of the viewport height to determine the OpenGL y coordinate to use
    for glReadPixels.

    [cogl] Make sure we draw upside down to offscreen draw buffers
    
    First a few notes about Cogl coordinate systems:
    - Cogl defines the window origin, viewport origin and texture coordinates
    origin to be top left unlike OpenGL which defines them as bottom left.
    - Cogl defines the modelview and projection identity matrices in exactly the
    same way as OpenGL.
    - I.e. we believe that for 2D centric constructs: windows/framebuffers,
    viewports and textures developers are more used to dealing with a top left
    origin, but when modeling objects in 3D; an origin at the center with y
    going up is quite natural.
    
    The way Cogl handles textures is by uploading data upside down in OpenGL
    terms so that bottom left becomes top left.  (Note: This also has the
    benefit that we don't need to flip the data we get from image decoding
    libraries since they typically also consider top left to be the image
    origin.)
    
    The viewport and window coords are mostly handled with various y =
    height - y tweaks before we pass y coordinates to OpenGL.
    
    Generally speaking though the handling of coordinate spaces in Cogl is a bit
    fragile.  I guess partly because none of it was design to be, it just
    evolved from how Clutter defines its coordinates without much consideration
    or testing.  I hope to improve this over a number of commits; starting here.
    
    This commit deals with the fact that offscreen draw buffers may be bound to
    textures but we don't "upload" the texture data upside down, and so if you
    texture from an offscreen draw buffer you need to manually flip the texture
    coordinates to get it the right way around.  We now force offscreen
    rendering to be flipped upside down by tweaking the projection matrix right
    before we submit it to OpenGL to scale y by -1.  The tweak is entirely
    hidden from the user such that if you call cogl_get_projection you will not
    see this scale.

    [draw-buffers] First pass at overhauling Cogl's framebuffer management
    
    Cogl's support for offscreen rendering was originally written just to support
    the clutter_texture_new_from_actor API and due to lack of documentation and
    several confusing - non orthogonal - side effects of using the API it wasn't
    really possible to use directly.
    
    This commit does a number of things:
    - It removes {gl,gles}/cogl-fbo.{c,h} and adds shared cogl-draw-buffer.{c,h}
      files instead which should be easier to maintain.
    - internally CoglFbo objects are now called CoglDrawBuffers. A
      CoglDrawBuffer is an abstract base class that is inherited from to
      implement CoglOnscreen and CoglOffscreen draw buffers.  CoglOffscreen draw
      buffers will initially be used to support the
      cogl_offscreen_new_to_texture API, and CoglOnscreen draw buffers will
      start to be used internally to represent windows as we aim to migrate some
      of Clutter's backend code to Cogl.
    - It makes draw buffer objects the owners of the following state:
      - viewport
      - projection matrix stack
      - modelview matrix stack
      - clip state
    (This means when you switch between draw buffers you will automatically be
     switching to their associated viewport, matrix and clip state)
    
    Aside from hopefully making cogl_offscreen_new_to_texture be more useful
    short term by having simpler and well defined semantics for
    cogl_set_draw_buffer, as mentioned above this is the first step for a couple
    of other things:
    - Its a step toward moving ownership for windows down from Clutter backends
      into Cogl, by (internally at least) introducing the CoglOnscreen draw
      buffer.  Note: the plan is that cogl_set_draw_buffer will accept on or
      offscreen draw buffer handles, and the "target" argument will become
      redundant since we will instead query the type of the given draw buffer
      handle.
    - Because we have a common type for on and offscreen framebuffers we can
      provide a unified API for framebuffer management. Things like:
      - blitting between buffers
      - managing ancillary buffers (e.g. attaching depth and stencil buffers)
      - size requisition
      - clearing

    [stage-x11] Ensure viewport is initialized before first stage paint
    
    This ensures that glViewport is called before the first stage paint.
    Previously _clutter_stage_maybe_setup_viewport (which is done before we
    start painting) was bailing out without calling cogl_setup_viewport because
    the CLUTTER_STAGE_IN_RESIZE flag may be set if the stage was resized before
    the first paint.  (NB: The CLUTTER_STAGE_IN_RESIZE flag isn't removed until
    we get an explicit event back from the X server since the window manager may
    choose to deny/alter the resize.)
    
    We now special case the first resize - where the viewport hasn't previously
    been initialized and use the requested geometry to initialize the
    glViewport without waiting for a reply from the server.

    Over time the two cogl-fbo.c files have needlessly diverged as bug fixes or

    [cogl-fbo] Remove poorly documented workaround for unknown driver/hardware
    
    The comment just said: "Some implementation require a clear before drawing
    to an fbo.  Luckily it is affected by scissor test." and did a scissored
    clear, which is clearly a driver bug workaround, but for what driver?  The
    fact that it was copied into the gles backend (or vica versa is also
    suspicious since it seems unlikely that the workaround is necessary for both
    backends.)
    
    We can easily restore the workaround with a better comment if this problem
    really still exists on current drivers, but for now I'd rather minimize
    hand-wavey workaround code that can't be tested.

    The solution is to round up by 0.5 and then use floorf(). This
    gives predictable and correct results on both 32bit and 64bit
    systems.

    layout: Do not create a LayoutMeta on remove
    
    When calling remove_child_meta() we check if there is a LayoutMeta
    already attached to the Actor, and if that LayoutMeta matches the
    (manager, container, actor) tuple. If the LayoutMeta does not match,
    though, we create a new LayoutMeta instance -- in order to remove it
    right afterwards.
    
    Instead of doing this, we can simply check for a matching LayoutMeta
    and if present, remove it.
    
    In case of an existing, non-matching LayoutMeta, we're left with a
    dangling instance, but it does not matter: the removal happens in the
    unparenting phase of a ClutterContainer, so either the Actor will be
    destroyed and thus the LayoutMeta will be disposed along with it; or
    it will be parented to another container, and thus the LayoutMeta
    will be replaced.

    build: Make COGL pass distcheck
    
    Some changes to make COGL pass distcheck with Automake 1.11 and
    anal-retentiveness turned up to 11.
    
    The "major" change is the flattening of the winsys/ part of COGL,
    which is built directly inside libclutter-cogl.la instead of an
    intermediate libclutter-cogl-winsys.la object.
    
    Ideally, the whole COGL should be flattened out using a
    quasi-non-recursive Automake layout; unfortunately, the driver/
    sub-section ships with identical targets and Automake cannot
    distinguish GL and GLES objects.

    actor: Identify allocation cycles
    
    If an actor calls directly or indirectly clutter_actor_queue_relayout()
    on itself from within the allocate() implementation it will cause a
    relayout cycle. This is usually a condition that should be checked by
    ClutterActor and we should emit a warning if it is verified.

    alpha: Allow setting the function in ClutterScript
    
    When defining an Alpha in ClutterScript we should allow setting
    the alpha function by using a custom property. This makes it
    possible to have both:
    
      {
        "id" : "behaviour-1",
        "type" : "ClutterBehaviourDepth",
        "alpha" : { "timeline" : "timeline-1", "function" : "alpha_func" },
        ...
      }
    
    And:
    
      {
        "id" : "alpha-1",
        "type" : "ClutterAlpha",
        "timeline" : "timeline-1",
        "function" : "alpha_func"
      },
      {
        "id" : "behaviour-1",
        "type" : "ClutterBehaviourDepth",
        "alpha" : "alpha-1",
        ...
      }
    
    The latter allows defining a single alpha function for multiple
    behaviours.

    Force a relayout when showing an actor
    
    When an actor is hidden, the parent actor is not required to
    size request or allocate it. (ClutterGroup does, but, for example,
    NbtkBoxLayout doesn't.) This means that the
    needs_width_request/needs_height_request/needs_allocate can be
    stale when we go to show it again - they are set for the actor
    but not the parent. Explicitly setting them to FALSE avoids
    clutter_actor_relayout() improperly short-circuiting.

    The change in commit 3bbc96e17e5a03ba931c86a5cd2a0ecaa2a3b77b moved the
    :text property setter to use set_text_internal(); this function does not

    the behaviour of ClutterText when setting the contents of the actor using
    the property.

    [gles2] remove lots of redundant matrix stack code
    
    Since we no longer depend on the GL matrix API in Cogl we can remove a lot
    of wrapper code from the GLES 2 backend.  This is particularly nice given
    that there was no code shared between the cogl-matrix-stack API and gles2
    wrappers so we had a lot of duplicated logic.

    [cogl] Removes the cogl-current-matrix abstraction
    
    The indirection through this API isn't necessary since we no longer
    arbitrate between the OpenGL matrix API and Cogl's client side API.  Also it
    doesn't help to maintain an OpenGL style matrix mode API for internal use
    since it's awkward to keep restoring the MODELVIEW mode and easy enough to
    directly work with the matrix stacks of interest.
    
    This replaces use of the _cogl_current_matrix API with direct use of the
    _cogl_matrix_stack API.  All the unused cogl_current_matrix API is removed
    and the matrix utility code left in cogl-current-matrix.c was moved to
    cogl.c.

    in _cogl_matrix_stack_flush_to_gl when we have lots of sequential modelview
    matrix modifications.

    matrix-stack: more optimization for load_identity case
    
    This goes a bit further than the previous patch, and as a special case
    we now simply represent identity matrices using a boolean, and only
    lazily initialize them when they need to be modified.

    [matrix-stack] avoid redundant clearing of matrix when using load_identity
    
    The journal always uses an identity matrix since it uses software
    transformation.  Currently it manually uses glLoadMatrix since previous
    experimentation showed that the cogl-matrix-stack gave bad performance, but
    it would be nice to fix performance so we only have to care about one path
    for loading matrices.
    
    For the common case where we do:
    cogl_matrix_stack_push()
    cogl_matrix_stack_load_identity()
    we were effectively initializing the matrix 3 times. Once due to use of
    g_slice_new0, then we had a cogl_matrix_init_identity in
    _cogl_matrix_state_new for good measure, and then finally in
    cogl_matrix_stack_load_identity we did another cogl_matrix_init_identity.
    
    We don't use g_slice_new0 anymore, _cogl_matrix_state_new is documented as
    not initializing the matrix (instead _cogl_matrix_stack_top_mutable now
    takes a boolean to choose if new stack entries should be initialised) and so
    we now only initialize once in cogl_matrix_stack_load_identity.

    [current-matrix] Adds texture matrix stacks + removes GL matrix API usage
    
    This relates back to an earlier commitment to stop using the OpenGL matrix
    API which is considered deprecated. (ref 54159f5a1d029db)
    
    The new texture matrix stacks are hung from a list of (internal only)
    CoglTextureUnit structures which the CoglMaterial code internally references
    via _cogl_get_texure_unit ().
    
    So we would be left with only the cogl-matrix-stack code being responsible
    for glMatrixMode, glLoadMatrix and glLoadIdentity this commit updates the
    journal code so it now uses the matrix-stack API instead of GL directly.

    [cogl-spans] split out cogl-spans code from cogl-texture-2d-sliced
    
    When we implement atlas textures we will probably want to use the spans API
    to handle texture repeating so it doesn't make sense to leave the code in
    cogl-texture-2d-sliced.c.  Since it's a standalone set of data structures
    and algorithms it also seems reasonable to split out from cogl-texture.

    [cogl-texture] Seal CoglTexture internals from cogl-primitives.c
    
    cogl-primitives.c was previously digging right into CoglTextures so it could
    manually iterate the texture slices for texturing quads and polygons and
    because we were missing some state getters we were lazily just poking into
    the structures directly.
    
    This adds some extra state getter functions, and adds a higher level
    _cogl_texture_foreach_slice () API that hopefully simplifies the way in
    which sliced textures may be used to render primitives.  This lets you
    specify a rectangle in "virtual" texture coords and it will call a given
    callback for each slice that intersects that rectangle giving the virtual
    coords of the current slice and corresponding "real" texture coordinates for
    the underlying gl texture.
    
    At the same time a noteable bug in how we previously iterated sliced
    textures was fixed, whereby we weren't correctly handling inverted texture
    coordinates.  E.g.  with the previous code if you supplied texture coords of
    tx1=100,ty1=0,tx2=0,ty2=100 (inverted along y axis) that would result in a
    back-facing quad, which could be discarded if using back-face culling.

commit 43efab46bcf88c14cc429c6c7b659bdbc84f1f71

    Intial Re-layout of the Cogl source code and introduction of a Cogl Winsys
    
    As part of an incremental process to have Cogl be a standalone project we
    want to re-consider how we organise the Cogl source code.
    
    Currently this is the structure I'm aiming for:
    cogl/
        cogl/
    	<put common source here>
    	winsys/
    	   cogl-glx.c
    	   cogl-wgl.c
    	driver/
    	    gl/
    	    gles/
    	os/ ?
        utils/
    	cogl-fixed
    	cogl-matrix-stack?
            cogl-journal?
            cogl-primitives?
        pango/
    
    The new winsys component is a starting point for migrating window system
    code (i.e.  x11,glx,wgl,osx,egl etc) from Clutter to Cogl.
    
    The utils/ and pango/ directories aren't added by this commit, but they are
    noted because I plan to add them soon.
    
    Overview of the planned structure:
    
    * The winsys/ API is the API that binds OpenGL to a specific window system,
      be that X11 or win32 etc.  Example are glx, wgl and egl. Much of the logic
      under clutter/{glx,osx,win32 etc} should migrate here.
    
    * Note there is also the idea of a winsys-base that may represent a window
      system for which there are multiple winsys APIs.  An example of this is
      x11, since glx and egl may both be used with x11.  (currently only Clutter
      has the idea of a winsys-base)
    
    * The driver/ represents a specific varient of OpenGL. Currently we have "gl"
      representing OpenGL 1.4-2.1 (mostly fixed function) and "gles" representing
      GLES 1.1 (fixed funciton) and 2.0 (fully shader based)
    
    * Everything under cogl/ should fundamentally be supporting access to the
      GPU.  Essentially Cogl's most basic requirement is to provide a nice GPU
      Graphics API and drawing a line between this and the utility functionality
      we add to support Clutter should help keep this lean and maintainable.
    
    * Code under utils/ as suggested builds on cogl/ adding more convenient
      APIs or mechanism to optimize special cases. Broadly speaking you can
      compare cogl/ to OpenGL and utils/ to GLU.
    
    * clutter/pango will be moved to clutter/cogl/pango
    
    How some of the internal configure.ac/pkg-config terminology has changed:
    backendextra -> CLUTTER_WINSYS_BASE # e.g. "x11"

    Note: The CLUTTER_FLAVOUR and CLUTTER_COGL defines are kept for apps
    
    As the first thing to take advantage of the new winsys component in Cogl;
    cogl_get_proc_address() has been moved from cogl/{gl,gles}/cogl.c into
    cogl/common/cogl.c and this common implementation first trys
    _cogl_winsys_get_proc_address() but if that fails then it falls back to
    gmodule.

commit 2eea83de75cec3dbc334feecd004a180a7f5b1e5
Author: Robert Bragg <robert@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 28 01:34:33 2009 +0100

    Make the CoglContext structure a bit more maintainable
    
    This moves most of cogl-context.{c.h} to cogl/common with some driver

    [stage-egl] support fallbacks in clutter_stage_egl_realize
    
    Most of clutter_stage_egl_realize was renamed to
    _clutter_stage_egl_try_realize which now takes a cookie indicating which
    fallback number should tried next.  clutter_stage_egl_realize now keeps
    trying to realize with successive fallback numbers until it succeeds or runs
    out of fallbacks.
    
    The only fallback supported for now is for hardware with no stencil buffer
    support.

    [backends] Remove the idea of offscreen stages from all backends
    
    The only backend that tried to implement offscreen stages was the GLX backend
    and even this has apparently be broken for some time without anyone noticing.
    
    The property still remains and since the property already clearly states that
    it may not work I don't expect anyone to notice.
    
    This simplifies quite a bit of the GLX code which is very desireable from the
    POV that we want to start migrating window system code down to Cogl and the
    simpler the code is the more straight forward this work will be.
    
    In the future when Cogl has a nicely designed API for framebuffer objects then
    re-implementing offscreen stages cleanly for *all* backends should be quite
    straightforward.

    [build] more Makefile.am.{enums,marshal} fixes for out of tree builds
    
    for the marshal files $(srcdir) was getting prefixed twice since my last
    commit (2cc88f1140) since it was already being prefixed including
    Makefile.am.  The problem with prefixing it in the includer file though is
    that the Make variable substitutions like :.list=.h mean we end up
    generating into the $(srcdir).  This removes the prefix added in
    clutter/Makefile.am
    
    We were also missing a $(srcdir) prefix when setting EXTRA_DIST

    When validating a new GValue against the ClutterParamSpecUnits, we issue
    a warning when the units do not match with both the new value and the
    unit we expect to have. Unfortunately we were printing the unit of the
    new value twice and not the unit of the ParamSpec.

    Add ClutterInterval integration
    
    To be able to animate CLUTTER_TYPE_UNITS properties we need to register
    the GType and its progress function against the ClutterInterval code.
    
    The two ClutterUnits defining the interval can use different units, the
    resulting unit will always be in pixels, so calculating a progress
    between 10px and 4cm is valid.

    units: Cache the pixels value inside Units
    
    When computing the pixels value of a ClutterUnits value we should
    be caching the value to avoid recomputing for every call of
    clutter_units_to_pixels(). We already have a flag telling us to
    return the cached value, but we miss the mechanism to evict the
    cache whenever the Backend settings affecting the conversion, that
    is default font and resolution, change.
    
    In order to implement the eviction we can use a "serial"; the
    Backend will have an internal serial field which we retrieve and
    put inside the ClutterUnits structure (we split one of the two
    64 bit padding fields into two 32 bit fields to maintain ABI); every
    time we call clutter_units_to_pixels() we compare the units serial
    with that of the Backend; if they match and pixels_set is set to
    TRUE then we just return the stored pixels value. If the serials
    do not match then we unset the pixels_set flag and recompute the
    pixels value.
    
    We can verify this by adding a simple test unit checking that
    by changing the resolution of ClutterBackend we get different
    pixel values for 1 em.

    layout: Report the correct size of FlowLayout
    
    FlowLayout should compute the correct height for the assigned width when
    in horizontal flow, and the correct width for the assigned height when
    in vertical flow. This means pre-computing the number of lines inside
    the get_preferred_width() and get_preferred_height(). We can then cache
    the computed column width and row height, cache them inside the layout
    and then use them when allocating the children.

    layout: Change the request-mode along with the orientation
    
    When changing the orientation of a FlowLayout, the associated
    container should also change its request mode. A horizontally
    flowing layout has a height depending on the width, since it
    will reflow vertically; similarly, a vertically reflowing layout
    will have a width depending on the height.

    The :wrap property is not implemented, and mostly useless: the
    FlowLayout is a reflowing grid. This means that if it receives
    less than the preferred width or height in the flow direction
    then it should always reflow.

    [layout] Initial implementation of FlowLayout
    
    FlowLayout is a layout manager that arranges its children in a
    reflowing line; the orientation controls the major axis for the
    layout: horizontal, for reflow on the Y axis, and vertical, for
    reflow on the X axis.

    [layout, tests] Use variants for child packing in Box
    
    There are three potential variants to add a child inside a Box
    with a BinLayout:
    
      - clutter_box_pack(), a variadic argument function which
        allows passing arbitrary LayoutMeta properties and values;
    
      - clutter_bin_layout_add(), which uses the backpointer to
        the container from the LayoutManager and sets the layout
        properties directly without GValue (de)marshalling
    
      - clutter_container_add_actor() and
        clutter_bin_layout_set_alignment(), similar to the
        clutter_bin_layout_add() function above, but split in two
    
    The test-box interactive test should exercise all three variants.

    [layout] Store and use the container inside BinLayout
    
    The BinLayout should store a pointer to the Container that it is
    using it as the layout manager.
    
    This allows us to fix the API and drop the additional Container
    arguments from set_alignment() and get_alignment().
    
    This also allows us to add a ClutterBinLayout::add() method which
    adds an actor and sets the alignment policies without dealing with
    variadic arguments functions and GValue (de)marshalling.

    [layout] Implement ClutterBox::add
    
    The ClutterBox::add method is a simple wrapper around the Container
    add_actor() method and the LayoutManager layout properties API. It
    allows adding an actor to a Box and setting the layout properties in
    one call.
    
    If the LayoutManager used by the Box does not support layout properties
    then the add() method short-circuits out.
    
    Along with the varargs version of the method there's also a vector-based
    variant, for language bindings to use.

    [layout] Add layers to BinLayout
    
    Each actor managed by a BinLayout policy should reside inside its
    own "layer", with horizontal and vertical alignment. The :x-align
    and :y-align properties of the BinLayout are the default alignment
    policies, which are copied to each new "layer" when it is created.
    
    The set_alignment() and get_alignment() methods of BinLayout can
    be changed to operate on a specific "layer".
    
    The whole machinery uses the new ChildMeta support inside the
    LayoutManager base abstract class.

    [layout] Notify of alignment changes in BinLayout
    
    Emit the ::layout-changed when the BinLayout alignment policies change.
    
    This will result in a queue_relayout() on the containers using the
    BinLayout layout manager.

    [layout] Add LayoutManager::layout-changed signal
    
    If a sub-class of LayoutManager wishes to implement a parametrized
    layout policy it also needs a way to notify the container using the
    layout manager that the layout has changed. We cannot do it directly
    and automatically from the LayoutManager because a) it has no back
    link to the actor that it is using it and b) it can be attached to
    multiple actors.
    
    This is a job for <cue raising dramatic music> signals!
    
    By adding ClutterLayoutManager::layout-changed (and its relative
    emitted function) we can notify actors using the layout manager that
    the layout parameters have been changed, and thus they should queue
    a relayout.

    [layout] Add BinLayout
    
    A BinLayout is a simple layout manager that allocates a single cell,
    providing alignment on both the horizontal and vertical axis.
    
    If the container associated to the BinLayout has more than one child,
    the preferred size returned by the layout manager will be as big as
    the maximum of the children preferred sizes; the allocation will be
    applied to all children - but it will still depend on each child
    preferred size and the BinLayout horizontal and vertical alignment
    properties.
    
    The supported alignment properties are:
    
      * center: align the child by centering it
      * start: align the child at the top or left border of the layout
      * end: align the child at the bottom or right border of the layout
      * fill: expand the child to fill the size of the layout
      * fixed: let the child position itself

    [layout] Make LayoutManager a floating object
    
    A layout manager instance makes only sense if it's owned by a
    container. For this reason, it should have a floating reference
    instead of a full reference on construction; this allows constructing
    Boxes like:
    
      box = clutter_box_new (clutter_fixed_layout_new ());
    
    without leaking the layout manager instance.

    [layout] Add initial implementation of LayoutManager
    
    The LayoutManager class is an abstract proxy for the size requesition
    and size allocation process in ClutterActor.
    
    A ClutterLayoutManager sub-class must implement get_preferred_width(),
    get_preferred_height() and allocate(); a ClutterContainer using the
    LayoutManager API will then proxy the corresponding Actor virtual
    functions to the LayoutManager instance. This allows having a generic
    "blank" ClutterActor sub-class, implementing the ClutterContainer
    interface, which leaves only the layout management implementation to
    the application developers.

    text: Make the :text property not set the :use-markup one
    
    Currently, setting the :text property has the side-effect of
    setting the :use-markup property to FALSE. This prevents
    constructing a Text actor, or setting its properties, like:
    
      g_object_set (text,
                    "use-markup", TRUE,
                    "text", some_string,
                    NULL);
    
    as the ordering becomes important. Unfortunately, the ordering
    of the properties cannot be enforced with ClutterScript or
    with language bindings.
    
    The documentation of the clutter_text_set_text() method should
    be expanded to properly specify that the set_text() method will
    change the :use-markup property to FALSE as a side effect.

    [units] Be more strict in the grammar we are parsing
    
    Current parsing of units has a number of shortcomings:
      * a number followed by trailing space (without any unit specified) was
        not recognized,
      * "5 emeralds" was parsed as 5em,
      * the way we parse the digits after the separator makes us lose
        precision for no good reason (5.0 is parsed as 5.00010014...f which
        makes g_assert_cmpfloat() fail)
    
    Let's define a stricter grammar we can recognize and try to do so. The
    description is in EBNF form, removing the optional <> which is a pain
    when having to write DocBook, and using '' for the terminal symbols.
    
    Last step, add more ClutterUnits unit test to get a better coverage of
    the grammar we want to parse.

    However the group is always allocated its size relative to its
    origin so if all of the children are to the right of the origin then
    the preferred size would not be large enough to reach the rightmost
    child.

    clutter_value_get_unit() has not be renamed
    
    Since the Great Rework of ClutterUnits, functions have been using
    'units' not 'unit' in their name. clutter_value_get_unit() is a left
    over from a dark age, its declaration and documentation have been

    [x11] Fix Stage user-initiated resize
    
    The user-initiated resize is conflicting with the allocated size. This
    happens because we change the size of the stage's X Window behind the
    back of the size allocation machinery.
    
    Instead, we should change the size of the actor whenever we receive a
    ConfigureNotify event to reflect the new size of the actor.

    [x11] Remove a useless forced paint
    
    We force the redraw before mapping, in the hope that when a composited
    window manager maps the window it will have its contents ready; that is
    not going to work: the solution for this problem requires the implementation
    of a protocol for compositors, and not a hack.
    
    Moreover, painting before mapping will cause a paint with the wrong
    GL viewport size, which is the wrong thing to do on GLX.

    [cogl-debug] avoid warnings when using COGL_NOTE with unbraced else clauses
    
    When not building a debug build the compiler was warning about empty
    else clauses with no braces due to code like:
      if (blah)
    	do_foo();
      else
    	COGL_NOTE (DRAW, "a-wibble");
    
    This simply ensures that even for non debug builds COGL_NOTE will expand to
    a single statement.

    [cogl-vertex-buffer] fix n_components validation for GL's builtin attributes
    
    glVertexPointer expects positions with 2, 3 or 4 components, glColorPointer
    expects colors with 3 or 4 components and glNormalPointer expects normals
    with three components so when adding vertex buffer atributes with the names
    "gl_Vertex", "gl_Color" or "gl_Normal" we assert these constraints and print
    an explanation to the developer if not met.
    
    This also fixes the previosly incorrect constraint that gl_Normal attributes
    must have n_components == 1; thanks to Cat Sidhe for reporting this:

    [debug] Adds a dump-pick-buffers CLUTTER_DEBUG option
    
    Now if you export CLUTTER_DEBUG=dump-pick-buffers clutter will write out a
    png, e.g.  pick-buffer-00000.png, each time _clutter_to_pick() is called.
    It's a rather crude way to debug the picking (realtime visualization in a
    second stage would probably be nicer) but it we've used this approach
    successfully numerous times when debugging Clutter picking issues so it
    makes sense to have a debug option for it.

    It looks like the intention was to duplicate an XVisualInfo in such a way
    that the pointer could be returned and then later freed using XFree.  But
    Xalloc isn't an Xlib counterpart to XFree; Xlib doesn't provide a general
    purpose malloc wrapper afik.  By shuffling things about a bit, it was
    possible to avoid the need for this hack.

    [cogl] Remove CoglContext->journal_vbo{,_len}
    
    The lifetime of the journal VBO is entirely within the scope of the
    cogl_journal_flush function so there is no need to store it globally
    in the Cogl context. Instead, upload_vertices_to_vbo just returns the
    new VBO. cogl_journal_flush stores this in a local variable and
    destroys it before returning.
    
    This also fixes an assertion when using the GLES backend which was
    caused by nothing initialising the journal_vbo variable.

    [cogl-fbo] Disable mipmap filters before calling glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT
    
    The framebuffer_object spec isn't clear in defining whether attaching a
    texture as a renderbuffer with mipmap filtering enabled while the mipmaps
    have not been uploaded should result in an incomplete framebuffer object.
    (different drivers make different decisions)
    
    To avoid an error with drivers that do consider this a problem we explicitly
    set non mipmapped filters before calling glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT.  The
    filters will later be reset when the texture is actually used for rendering
    according to the filters set on the corresponding CoglMaterial.

    [stage] Rework the Stage implementation class
    
    Instead of using ClutterActor for the base class of the Stage
    implementation we should extend the StageWindow interface with
    the required bits (geometry, realization) and use a simple object
    class.
    
    This require a wee bit of changes across Backend, Stage and
    StageWindow, even though it's mostly re-shuffling.
    
    First of all, StageWindow should get new virtual functions:
    
      * geometry:
        - resize()
        - get_geometry()
    
      * realization
        - realize()
        - unrealize()
    
    This covers all the bits that we use from ClutterActor currently
    inside the stage implementations.
    
    The ClutterBackend::create_stage() virtual function should create
    a StageWindow, and not an Actor (it should always have been; the
    fact that it returned an Actor was a leak of the black magic going
    on underneath). Since we never guaranteed ABI compatibility for
    the Backend class, this is not a problem.
    
    Internally to ClutterStage we can finally drop the shenanigans of
    setting/unsetting actor flags on the implementation: if the realization
    succeeds, for instance, we set the REALIZED flag on the Stage and
    we're done.
    
    As an initial proof of concept, the X11 and GLX stage implementations
    have been ported to the New World Order(tm) and show no regressions.

    [animation] Move the check for the 'signal::' prefix into a separate function
    
    The old code checked whether the property began with 'signal-' and
    then checked for 'signal-swapped' and 'signal-after'. This prevented
    you from animating a property called for example 'signal-strength'.
    
    The check for the prefix is now in a separate function which also adds
    a 'signal-swapped-after' prefix for completeness.

    [animation] Add Animation::update()
    
    Currently, to update a property inside an animation you have to
    get the interval for that property and then call the set_final_value()
    method.
    
    We can provide a simpler, bind()-like method for the convenience of
    the developers that just validates everything and then calls the
    Interval.set_final_value().

    Add ::queue-relayout signal to ClutterActor for ClutterClone
    
    ClutterClone bases its preferred size on the preferred size of
    the source actor, so it needs to invalid its cached preferred
    size when the preferred size of the source actor changes.
    
    In order for this to work, we need to have notification when
    the size of the source actor changes, so add a ::queue-relayout
    signal to ClutterActor.
    
    Then connect to this from ClutterClone and queue a relayout
    on the clone when a relayout is queued on the source.

    Revert "[cogl] Allow Cogl to create NPOT textures for GLES2"
    
    This reverts commit 3c47a3beb51462ef8af1070b75123660059e97d0.
    
    Of course I remembered just after pushing the patch why we hadn't done
    this before :-) If you look in the glsl spec:
    http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/specs/2.0/es_full_spec_2.0.24.pdf
    Section 3.7.10 Texture Completeness and Non-Power-Of-Two Textures
    you can see GLES 2.0 doesn't support mipmaps for npot textures.
    
    There is possibly some way we could support this in Cogl but at least
    it's not as simple as or-ing in the feature flag, sadly.

    _cogl_features_init.

    [text] Don't interpret the unicode value when the control modifier is on
    
    When a letter key is pressed with the control key held down one of
    three things will happen :-
    
    a) If the stage is embedded within a GtkClutterEmbed the unicode value
       will be filled from gdk_keyval_to_unicode. This will be the same
       value as if control was not pressed (so Ctrl+V will be 'v').
    
    b) If the stage is not in a GtkClutterEmbed and Clutter is running on
       the X11 backend then it will try to fill in the unicode value from
       XLookupString. This *will* take into account the control so the
       unicode value will represent a control character (Ctrl+V will be
       '\x16').
    
    c) Most other backends will not bother to fill in the unicode
       value. Therefore clutter_keysym_to_unicode will be used which also
       does not take into account the control key (so Ctrl+V will be 'v').
    
    For cut and paste to work in Nbtk, the control keys need to bubble up
    to the parent NbtkEntry container. This works fine for 'b' but not 'a'
    and 'c'.
    
    This patch makes ClutterText always allow the event to bubble if the
    key is not handled by the binding pool and the control modifier is
    down.
    
    Ideally ClutterText would always get a unicode value that takes into
    account the modifiers but this is probably best left up to the input
    methods.

    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH when running g-ir-compiler
    
    g-ir-compiler currently opens the library for the .gir it is compiling;
    to make that work we need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running
    g-ir-compiler to include .libs.
    
    (I think this may have been working earlier because there was a
    hack that substituted .so with .la and tried opening that; that
    works for the incorrect libclutter-glx-1.0.so but not for the
    correct libclutter-glx-1.0.so.0)

    Full fix for the G-I support in Clutter
    
    Update the sed hack for the shared library to be more robust.
    
    Remove the --shared-library command line argument from g-ir-scanner,
    as no distribution will ever ship the .la files. This effectively
    reverts commit 68f8a98cfbf70e2b7bfcda7831907633eb08ca50.

    Update Clutter to use G-I 0.6.4
    
    Following bug #1762, the syntax of g-ir-scanner was changed in
    gobject-introspection, so Clutter does not build anymore with 0.6.4.
    
    See the bugzilla bug:
    
      http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=591669
    
    GObject-Introspection now uses a different mechanism to extract the
    SONAME when building the gir file and it needs the libtool archive as
    option.

    [units] Do not be locale-dependant on string conversion
    
    When dumping a ClutterUnits structure to a string we are using a bare
    g_strdup_printf(), which unfortunately is locale dependant. So, for
    instance, a type of CLUTTER_UNIT_EM and a value of 42 are stringified
    as:
    
            C:      42.00 em
            en_GB   42.00 em
            it_IT   42,00 em
            fr_FR   42,00 em
    
    This would not be a problem -- clutter_units_from_string() allows both
    '.' and ',' as fractionary part delimiters. The test suite, on the
    other hand, does not know that, and it checks for exact matches with
    the C locale.
    
    Calling setlocale(LC_ALL,"C") at the beginning of the conformance test
    suite is not a good idea, because it would prevent external testing; and
    it's a lame cop out from doing exactly what we have to do -- pick a format
    and stick with it.
    
    Like other platforms, languages and frameworks before us, we opt to
    be less liberal in what we create; so, we choose to always stringify
    ClutterUnits with fractionary parts using '.' as the delimiter.

    Add new Atom atom_NET_WM_PID to set pid info
    
    Clutter advertises itself on X11 as implementing the _NET_WM_PING protocol,
    which is needed to be able to detect frozen applications; this allows us to
    stop the destruction of the stage by blocking the CLUTTER_DELETE event and
    wait for user feedback without the Window Manager thinking that the app has
    gone unresponsive.
    
    In order to implement the _NET_WM_PING protocol properly, though, we need
    to add the _NET_WM_PID property on the Stage window, since the EWMH states:
    
      [_NET_WM_PID] MAY be used by the Window Manager to kill windows which
      do not respond to the _NET_WM_PING protocol.
    
    Meaning that an unresponsive Clutter application might not be killable by
    the window manager.

    [actor] Allow unsetting width and height separately
    
    It is possible to unset the size of an actor specified with set_width()
    and set_height() by using:
    
      clutter_actor_set_size (actor, -1, -1);
    
    Which works by unsetting the :min-*-set and the :natural-*-set properties.
    
    Calling set_width(-1) and set_height(-1) separately, though, doesn't work
    thus implicitly breaking the assumption that set_size() is nothing more
    than set_width()+set_height(). This was obviously due to the face that
    pre-1.0 set_width() and set_height() took an unsigned integer as an
    argument.

    [script] Fix Actor's ad-hoc parser
    
    ClutterActor parses positional and dimensional properties with a
    custom deserializer. We need to:
    
      - handle G_TYPE_INT64, the default integer type for JSON-GLib
      - use G_TYPE_FLOAT for properties, since Actor switched to it
        for the pixel-based ones
    
    This makes ClutterScript work again.

    The json-types.h header is found by the mere fact of it being

    We need to use clutter-json.h, which will include the right

    [x11] Do not ask to destroy an empty Window
    
    The fix for bug 1750 inside commit b190448e made Clutter-GTK spew
    BadWindow errors. The reason for that is that we call XDestroyWindow()
    without checking if the old Window is None; this happens if we call
    clutter_x11_set_stage_foreign() on a new ClutterStage before it has
    been realized.
    
    Since Clutter-GTK does not need to realize the Stage it is going to
    embed anymore (the only reason for that was to obtain a proper Visual
    but now there's ClutterBackendX11 API for that), the set_stage_foreign()
    call is effectively setting the StageX11 Window for the first time.

    [x11] Destroy the Window we own when setting a foreign one
    
    When we replace the stage Window using a foreign one we also need to
    destroy the Window we created, if needed, to avoid leaking resources
    all around.

    [actor] Be more explicit when warning about invariants
    
    The "catch all" warning for a the mapped invariant violation is too
    generic: it doesn't tell you why the invariant was broken in case
    we are trying to map an unparented actor - e.g. through a Clone.

    [debug] Fix __GNUC__ typo
    
    The right gcc define is __GNUC__ not __GNUC_. This typo had the side

    a less optmised CLUTTER_NOTE () than one could have dreamed of.

    [actor] Use the right vertex
    
    The vertex that should be used by the apply_relative_transform
    is the one passed in as const, and the result should be placed
    inside the non-const ClutterVertext. Currently, we are using
    the latter, and thus the function is completely useless.

    [script] Simplify the parser code
    
    JSON-GLib provides simple accessors for basic types so that we
    can avoid getting the JsonNode out of a complex type. This makes
    the code simpler to understand.

commit 354fa437cdc4b67ca6c2452756a261222109b289

    Update JSON-GLib dependency
    
    Currently, Clutter depends on the internal copy of JSON-GLib for
    the ClutterScript parser. This is done to allow building Clutter
    on platforms that do not have the library installed on the system.
    
    Just like we use the internal PNG/JPEG loader as a fallback in
    case we don't have GdkPixbuf or CoreGraphics available, we should
    use the internal copy of JSON-GLib only in case the system copy
    is not present.
    
    The change is simply to move the default for the --with-json
    configure switch from "internal" to "check".
    
    In order to allow stricter compliance, a third setting should
    be present: "system", which fails if the system copy is not
    available.
    
    We should also change the introspection generation to avoid
    breaking in case we require the installed Json-1.0.gir instead
    of the generated ClutterJson.gir
